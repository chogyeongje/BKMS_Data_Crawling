Machine learning classifiers and fMRI: a tutorial overview,"Francisco Pereira, Tom Mitchell, Matthew Botvinick",2009/3/1,Neuroimage,45,1,S199-S209,Academic Press,"Interpreting brain image experiments requires analysis of complex, multivariate data. In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of ‘is there information about a variable of interest’ (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely ‘where is the information’ (pattern localization) and ‘how is that information encoded’ (pattern characterization).",1593회,"Machine learning classifiers and fMRI: a tutorial overview

Predicting human brain activity associated with the meanings of nouns,"Tom M Mitchell, Svetlana V Shinkareva, Andrew Carlson, Kai-Min Chang, Vicente L Malave, Robert A Mason, Marcel Adam Just",2008/5/30,,320,5880,1191-1195,American Association for the Advancement of Science,"The question of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been debated in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of pictures and words (for example, tools, buildings, and animals). We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation associated with words for which fMRI data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.",1229회,"Predicting human brain activity associated with the meanings of nouns

The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web.

Zero-shot learning with semantic output codes,"Mark M Palatucci, Dean A Pomerleau, Geoffrey E Hinton, Tom Mitchell",2009/12,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,"We consider the problem of zero-shot learning, where the goal is to learn a classifier f: X → Y that must predict novel values of Y that were omitted from the training set. To achieve this, we define the notion of a semantic output code classifier (SOC) which utilizes a knowledge base of semantic properties of Y to extrapolate to novel classes. We provide a formalism for this type of classifier and study its theoretical properties in a PAC framework, showing conditions under which the classifier can accurately predict novel classes. As a case study, we build a SOC classifier for a neural decoding task and show that it can often predict words that people are thinking about from functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) of their neural activity, even without training examples for those words.",858회,"Zero-shot learning with semantic output codes

The US patent database and Yahoo are two examples. This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classifier can be significantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies.

We describe the design of one particular learning assistant: a calendar manager, called CAP (Calendar APprentice), that learns user scheduling preferences from experience. Results are summarized from approximately five user-years of experience, during which CAP has learned an evolving set of several thousand rules that characterize the scheduling preferences of its users.

Random walk inference and learning in a large scale knowledge base,"Ni Lao, Tom Mitchell, William Cohen",2011/7,,,,529-539,,"We consider the problem of performing learning and inference in a large scale knowledge base containing imperfect knowledge with incomplete coverage. We show that a soft inference procedure based on a combination of constrained, weighted, random walks through the knowledge base graph can be used to reliably infer new beliefs for the knowledge base. More specifically, we show that the system can learn to infer different target relations by tuning the weights associated with random walks that follow different paths through the graph, using a version of the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010b). We apply this approach to a knowledge base of approximately 500,000 beliefs extracted imperfectly from the web by NELL, a never-ending language learner (Carlson et al., 2010). This new system improves significantly over NELL’s earlier Horn-clause learning and inference method: it obtains nearly double the precision at rank 100, and the new learning method is also applicable to many more inference tasks.",552회,"Random walk inference and learning in a large scale knowledge base

Using EM to classify text from labeled and unlabeled documents,"Kamal Nigam, Andrew McCallum, Sebastian Thrun, Tom Mitchell",1998/5/11,,,,,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIV PITTSBURGH PA SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE,"This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is significant because in many important text classification problems obtaining classification labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available. We present a theoretical argument showing that, under common assumptions, unlabeled data contain information about the target function. We then introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled text, based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30.

This paper pursues the thesis that much greater accuracy can be achieved by further constraining the learning task, by coupling the semi-supervised training of many extractors for different categories and relations.

Version spaces: an approach to concept learning.,Tom Michael Mitchell,1978/12/1,,,,,STANFORD UNIV CALIF DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE,"A method is presented for learning general descriptions of concepts from a sequence of positive and negative training instances. This method involves examining a predetermined space or language of possible concept descriptions, finding those which are consistent with the observed training instances. Rather than use heuristic search techniques to examine this concept description space, the subspace version space of all plausible concept descriptions is represented and updated with each training instance. This version space approach determines all concept descriptions consistent with the training instances, without backtracking to reexamine past training instances or previously rejected concept descriptions. Proofs are given for the correctness of the method for representing version spaces, and of the associated concept learning algorithm, for any countably infinite concept description language. Empirical results obtained from computer implementations in two domains are presented. The version space approach has been implemented as one component of the Meta-DENDRAL program for learning production rules in the domain of chemical spectroscopy. Its implementation in this program is described in detail.

We believe that it should be generative in 3D, in the sense that it can produce new 3D objects; as well as be predictable from 2D, in the sense that it can be perceived from 2D images. We propose a novel architecture, called the TL-embedding network, to learn an embedding space with these properties. The network consists of two components: (a) an autoencoder that ensures the representation is generative; and (b) a convolutional network that ensures the representation is predictable. This enables tackling a number of tasks including voxel prediction from 2D images and 3D model retrieval. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the usefulness and versatility of this embedding.",469회,"Learning a predictable and generative vector representation for objects

Recent research on learning robot control has predominantly focused on learning single tasks that were studied in isolation. If robots encounter a multitude of control learning tasks over their entire lifetime there is an opportunity to transfer knowledge between them. In order to do so, robots may learn the invariants and the regularities of the individual tasks and environments. This task-independent knowledge can be employed to bias generalization when learning control, which reduces the need for real-world experimentation. We argue that knowledge transfer is essential if robots are to learn control with moderate learning times in complex scenarios.

This is true both for cognitive science models of learning such as SOAR [Newell 1990] and ACT–R [Anderson, et al. 1995], and for machine learning and data mining algorithms such as decision tree learning and inductive logic programming (see, e.g., [Mitchell 1997]). In this paper we consider the potential role of unlabeled data in supervised learning. We present an algorithm and experimental results demonstrating that unlabeled data can significantly improve learning accuracy in certain practical problems. We then identify the abstract problem structure that enables the algorithm to successfully utilize this unlabeled data, and prove that unlabeled data will boost learning accuracy for problems in this class. The problem class we identify includes problems where the …",269회,"The role of unlabeled data in supervised learning

Redefining designing: From form to experience,C Thomas Mitchell,1993,,,,,Van Nostrand Reinhold Company,"Redefining Designing From Form to Experience C. Thomas Mitchell Redefining Designing: From Form to Experience offers a comprehensive new theory of design in which user needs and wishes are central. This landmark work focuses on design in terms of human experience rather than physical form. The book offers a highly critical study of design philosophies that have emerged since industrialization: modernism, late modernism, postmodernism, and deconstruction. C. Thomas Mitchell points out how many designs, particularly in architecture, fail to suit their intended purpose not because of their style but because of the design process itself. Mitchell then reviews user-responsive design methods, which he calls"" design turned inside-out."" He explores collaborative, contextual, and intangible design, and cites examples of each. International case studies illustrate up-to-the-minute topics such as"" humanware,"" softecnica, the pattern language, and soft design. Also featured is an interview with Brian Eno and graphic work by artists Christo and Robert Wilson. Many never-before published illustrations enhance the book throughout.

Using fMRI brain activation to identify cognitive states associated with perception of tools and dwellings,"Svetlana V Shinkareva, Robert A Mason, Vicente L Malave, Wei Wang, Tom M Mitchell, Marcel Adam Just",2008/1/2,,3,1,e1394,Public Library of Science,"Previous studies have succeeded in identifying the cognitive state corresponding to the perception of a set of depicted categories, such as tools, by analyzing the accompanying pattern of brain activity, measured with fMRI. The current research focused on identifying the cognitive state associated with a 4s viewing of an individual line drawing (1 of 10 familiar objects, 5 tools and 5 dwellings, such as a hammer or a castle). Here we demonstrate the ability to reliably (1) identify which of the 10 drawings a participant was viewing, based on that participant's characteristic whole-brain neural activation patterns, excluding visual areas; (2) identify the category of the object with even higher accuracy, based on that participant's activation; and (3) identify, for the first time, both individual objects and the category of the object the participant was viewing, based only on other participants' activation patterns. The voxels important for category identification were located similarly across participants, and distributed throughout the cortex, focused in ventral temporal perceptual areas but also including more frontal association areas (and somewhat left-lateralized). These findings indicate the presence of stable, distributed, communal, and identifiable neural states corresponding to object concepts.",252회,"Using fMRI brain activation to identify cognitive states associated with perception of tools and dwellings

A neurosemantic theory of concrete noun representation based on the underlying brain codes,"Marcel Adam Just, Vladimir L Cherkassky, Sandesh Aryal, Tom M Mitchell",2010/1/13,,5,1,e8622,Public Library of Science,"This article describes the discovery of a set of biologically-driven semantic dimensions underlying the neural representation of concrete nouns, and then demonstrates how a resulting theory of noun representation can be used to identify simple thoughts through their fMRI patterns. We use factor analysis of fMRI brain imaging data to reveal the biological representation of individual concrete nouns like apple, in the absence of any pictorial stimuli. From this analysis emerge three main semantic factors underpinning the neural representation of nouns naming physical objects, which we label manipulation, shelter, and eating. Each factor is neurally represented in 3–4 different brain locations that correspond to a cortical network that co-activates in non-linguistic tasks, such as tool use pantomime for the manipulation factor. Several converging methods, such as the use of behavioral ratings of word meaning and text corpus characteristics, provide independent evidence of the centrality of these factors to the representations. The factors are then used with machine learning classifier techniques to show that the fMRI-measured brain representation of an individual concrete noun like apple can be identified with good accuracy from among 60 candidate words, using only the fMRI activity in the 16 locations associated with these factors. To further demonstrate the generativity of the proposed account, a theory-based model is developed to predict the brain activation patterns for words to which the algorithm has not been previously exposed. The methods, findings, and theory constitute a new approach of using brain activity for understanding how object …",226회,"A neurosemantic theory of concrete noun representation based on the underlying brain codes

Over the past decade, machine learning has evolved from a field of laboratory demonstrations to a field of significant commercial value.

Towards robust computerised marking of free-text responses,"Tom Mitchell, Terry Russell, Peter Broomhead, Nicola Aldridge",2002/7,,,,,Loughborough University,"This paper describes and exemplifies an application of AutoMark, a software system developed in pursuit of robust computerised marking of free-text answers to open-ended questions. AutoMark employs the techniques of Information Extraction to provide computerised marking of short free-text responses. The system incorporates a number of processing modules specifically aimed at providing robust marking in the face of errors in spelling, typing, syntax, and semantics. AutoMark looks for specific content within free-text answers, the content being specified in the form of a number of mark scheme templates. Each template represents one form of a valid (or a specifically invalid) answer. Student answers are first parsed, and then intelligently matched against each mark scheme template, and a mark for each answer is computed. The representation of the templates is such that they can be robustly mapped to multiple variations in the input text. The current paper describes AutoMark for the first time, and presents the results of a brief quantitative and qualitative study of the performance of the system in marking a range of free-text responses in one of the most demanding domains: statutory national curriculum assessment of science for pupils at age 11. This particular domain has been chosen to help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current system in marking responses where errors in spelling, syntax, and semantics are at their most frequent.

Becoming increasingly reactive,Tom M Mitchell,1990/8,,1,,4,,"We describe a robot control architecture which combines a stimulus-response subsystem for rapid reaction, with a search-based planner for handling unanticipated situations. The robot agent continually chooses which action it is to perform, using the stimulusresponse subsystem when possible, and falling back on the planning subsystem when necessary. Whenever it is forced to plan, it applies an explanation-based learning mechanism to formulate a new stimulus-response rule to cover this new situation and others similar to it. With experience, the agent becomes increasingly reactive as its learning component acquires new stimulus-response rules that eliminate the need for planning in similar subsequent situations. This Theo-Agent architecture is described, and results are presented demonstrating its ability to reduce routine reaction time for a simple mobile robot from minutes to under a second.",189회,"Becoming increasingly reactive

This approach is the first to simultaneously track diverse reading subprocesses during complex story processing and predict the detailed neural representation of diverse story features, ranging from visual word properties to the mention of different story characters and different actions they perform. We construct brain representation maps that replicate many results from a wide range of classical studies that focus each on one aspect of language processing and offer new insights on which type of information is processed by different areas involved in language processing.

Semi-Supervised Text Classification Using EM.,"Kamal Nigam, Andrew McCallum, Tom M Mitchell",2006/3/1,,,,32-55,,"For several decades, statisticians have advocated using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train classifiers by estimating parameters of a generative model through iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) techniques. This chapter explores the effectiveness of this approach when applied to the domain of text classification. Text documents are represented here with a bag-of-words model, which leads to a generative classification model based on a mixture of multinomials. This model is an extremely simplistic representation of the complexities of written text. This chapter explains and illustrates three key points about semi-supervised learning for text classification with generative models. First, despite the simplistic representation, some text domains have a high positive correlation between generative model probability and classification accuracy. In these domains, a straightforward application of EM with the naive Bayes text model works well. Second, some text domains do not have this correlation. Here we can adopt a more expressive and appropriate generative model that does have a positive correlation. In these domains, semi-supervised learning again improves classification accuracy. Finally, EM suffers from the problem of local maxima, especially in high dimension domains such as text classification. We demonstrate that deterministic annealing, a variant of EM, can help overcome the problem of local maxima and increase classification accuracy further when the generative model is appropriate.",188회,"Semi-Supervised Text Classification Using EM.

Leveraging knowledge bases in lstms for improving machine reading,"Bishan Yang, Tom Mitchell",2019/2/25,,,,,,"This paper focuses on how to take advantage of external knowledge bases (KBs) to improve recurrent neural networks for machine reading. Traditional methods that exploit knowledge from KBs encode knowledge as discrete indicator features. Not only do these features generalize poorly, but they require task-specific feature engineering to achieve good performance. We propose KBLSTM, a novel neural model that leverages continuous representations of KBs to enhance the learning of recurrent neural networks for machine reading. To effectively integrate background knowledge with information from the currently processed text, our model employs an attention mechanism with a sentinel to adaptively decide whether to attend to background knowledge and which information from KBs is useful. Experimental results show that our model achieves accuracies that surpass the previous state-of-the-art results for both entity extraction and event extraction on the widely used ACE2005 dataset.",175회,"Leveraging knowledge bases in lstms for improving machine reading

Memory approaches to reinforcement learning in non-Markovian domains,"Long-Ji Lin, Tom M Mitchell",1992/5/1,,,,,Carnegie-Mellon University. Department of Computer Science,"Reinforcement learning is a type of unsupervised learning for sequential decision making. Q-learning is probably the best-understood reinforcement learning algorithm. In Q-learning, the agent learns a mapping from states and actions to their utilities. An important assumption of Q-learning is the Markovian environment assumption, meaning that any information needed to determine the optimal actions is re ected in the agent's state representation. Consider an agent whose state representation is based solely on its immediate perceptual sensations. When its sensors are not able to make essential distinctions among world states, the Markov assumption is violated, causing a problem called perceptual aliasing. For example, when facing a closed box, an agent based on its current visual sensation cannot act optimally if the optimal action depends on the contents of the box. There are two basic approaches to addressing this problem| using more sensors or using history to gure out the current world state. This paper studies three connectionist approaches which learn to use history to handle perceptual aliasing: the window-Q, recurrent-Q, and recurrent-model architectures. Empirical study of these architectures is presented. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are also discussed.

This allows us to define a simpler algorithm for generating feature matrices from graphs, which we call subgraph feature extraction (SFE). In addition to being conceptually simpler than PRA, SFE is much more efficient, reducing computation by an order of magnitude, and more expressive, allowing for much richer features than paths between two nodes in a graph. We show experimentally that this technique gives substantially better performance than PRA and its variants, improving mean average precision from. 432 to. 528 on a knowledge base completion task using the NELL KB.",163회,"Efficient and expressive knowledge base completion using subgraph feature extraction

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach which yields semantic representation of words satisfying these three desirable properties. Though extensive experimental evaluations on multiple real-world tasks and datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of semantic models learned by NNSE over other state-of-the-art baselines.",145회,"Learning effective and interpretable semantic models using non-negative sparse embedding

Weakly supervised training of semantic parsers,"Jayant Krishnamurthy, Tom Mitchell",2012/7,,,,754-765,,"We present a method for training a semantic parser using only a knowledge base and an unlabeled text corpus, without any individually annotated sentences. Our key observation is that multiple forms of weak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependencyparsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-theart accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form.",144회,"Weakly supervised training of semantic parsers

Incorporating vector space similarity in random walk inference over knowledge bases,"Matt Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Jayant Krishnamurthy, Tom Mitchell",2014/10,,,,397-406,,"Much work in recent years has gone into the construction of large knowledge bases (KBs), such as Freebase, DBPedia, NELL, and YAGO. While these KBs are very large, they are still very incomplete, necessitating the use of inference to fill in gaps. Prior work has shown how to make use of a large text corpus to augment random walk inference over KBs. We present two improvements to the use of such large corpora to augment KB inference. First, we present a new technique for combining KB relations and surface text into a single graph representation that is much more compact than graphs used in prior work. Second, we describe how to incorporate vector space similarity into random walk inference over KBs, reducing the feature sparsity inherent in using surface text. This allows us to combine distributional similarity with symbolic logical inference in novel and effective ways. With experiments on many relations from two separate KBs, we show that our methods significantly outperform prior work on KB inference, both in the size of problem our methods can handle and in the quality of predictions made.",143회,"Incorporating vector space similarity in random walk inference over knowledge bases

Training fMRI classifiers to detect cognitive states across multiple human subjects,"Xuerui Wang, Rebecca Hutchinson, Tom M Mitchell",2003/12,,16,,,,"We consider learning to classify cognitive states of human subjects, based on their brain activity observed via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This problem is important because such classifiers constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden cognitive states, which may be useful in cognitive science research and clinical applications. In recent work, Mitchell, et al.[6, 7, 9] have demonstrated the feasibility of training such classifiers for individual human subjects (eg, to distinguish whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or unambiguous sentence, or whether they are reading a noun or a verb). Here we extend that line of research, exploring how to train classifiers that can be applied across multiple human subjects, including subjects who were not involved in training the classifier. We describe the design of several machine learning approaches to training multiple-subject classifiers, and report experimental results demonstrating the success of these methods in learning cross-subject classifiers for two different fMRI data sets.",137회,"Training fMRI classifiers to detect cognitive states across multiple human subjects

Bayesian Network Learning with Parameter Constraints.,"Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom M Mitchell, R Bharat Rao, Kristin P Bennett, Emilio Parrado-Hernández",2006/7/1,,7,7,,,"The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that constrains the values or relationships among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian network with known structure.
We incorporate a wide variety of parameter constraints into learning procedures for Bayesian networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The assumptions made in module networks, dynamic Bayes nets and context specific independence models can be viewed as particular cases of such parameter constraints. We present closed form solutions or fast iterative algorithms for estimating parameters subject to several specific classes of parameter constraints, including equalities and inequalities among parameters, constraints on individual parameters, and constraints on sums and ratios of parameters, for discrete and continuous variables. Our methods cover learning from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view, from both complete and incomplete data.",123회,"Bayesian Network Learning with Parameter Constraints.

Discovering test set regularities in relational domains,"Seán Slattery, Tom Mitchell",2000/6/29,,,,895-902,,"Machine learning typically involves discovering regularities in a training set, then applying these learned regularities to classify objects in a test set. In this paper we present an approach to discovering additional regularities in the test set, and show that in relational domains such test set regularities can be used to improve classification accuracy beyond that achieved using the training set alone. For example, we have previously shown how FOIL, a relational learner, can learn to classify Web pages by discovering training set regularities in the words occurring on target pages, and on other pages related by hyperlinks. Here we show how the classification accuracy of FOIL on this task can be improved by discovering additional regularities on the test set pages that must be classified. Our approach can be seen as an extension to Kleinberg’s Hubs and Authorities algorithm that analyzes hyperlink relations among Web pages. We present evidence that this new algorithm leads to better test set precision and recall on three binary Web classification tasks where the test set Web pages are taken from different Web sites than the training set.",121회,"Discovering test set regularities in relational domains

Joint extraction of events and entities within a document context,"Bishan Yang, Tom Mitchell",2016/9/12,,,,,,"Events and entities are closely related; entities are often actors or participants in events and events without entities are uncommon. The interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent. Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a strong baseline for entity extraction.",117회,"Joint extraction of events and entities within a document context

Discovering relations between noun categories,"Thahir Mohamed, Estevam Hruschka, Tom Mitchell",2011/7,,,,1447-1455,,"Traditional approaches to Relation Extraction from text require manually defining the relations to be extracted. We propose here an approach to automatically discovering relevant relations, given a large text corpus plus an initial ontology defining hundreds of noun categories (eg, Athlete, Musician, Instrument). Our approach discovers frequently stated relations between pairs of these categories, using a two step process. For each pair of categories (eg, Musician and Instrument) it first coclusters the text contexts that connect known instances of the two categories, generating a candidate relation for each resulting cluster. It then applies a trained classifier to determine which of these candidate relations is semantically valid. Our experiments apply this to a text corpus containing approximately 200 million web pages and an ontology containing 122 categories from the NELL system [Carlson et al., 2010b], producing a set of 781 proposed candidate relations, approximately half of which are semantically valid. We conclude this is a useful approach to semi-automatic extension of the ontology for large-scale information extraction systems such as NELL.",117회,"Discovering relations between noun categories

Semisupervised approaches using a small number of labeled examples together with many unlabeled examples are often unreliable as they frequently produce an internally consistent, but nevertheless incorrect set of extractions. We propose that this problem can be overcome by simultaneously learning classifiers for many different categories and relations in the presence of an ontology defining constraints that couple the training of these classifiers. Experimental results show that simultaneously learning a coupled collection of classifiers for 30 categories and relations results in much more accurate extractions than training classifiers individually.",109회,"Coupling semi-supervised learning of categories and relations

Active learning for information extraction with multiple view feature sets,"Rosie Jones, Rayid Ghani, Tom Mitchell, Ellen Riloff",2003/9/22,,,,26-34,,"A major problem with machine learning approaches to information extraction is the high cost of collecting labeled examples. Active learning seeks to make efficient use of a labeler's time by asking for labels based on the anticipated value of that label to the learner. We consider active learning approaches for information extraction problems where each example is described by two distinct sets of features, either of which is sufficient to approximate the function; that is, they fit the cotraining problem setting. We discuss a range of active learning algorithms and show that using feature set disagreement to select examples for active learning leads to improvements in extraction performance regardless of the choice of initially labeled examples. The result is an active learning approach to multiple view feature sets in general, and noun phrase extraction in particular, that significantly reduces training effort and compensates for errors in initially labeled data.",86회,"Active learning for information extraction with multiple view feature sets

The model details the functional components felt to be essential for any learning system, independent of the techniques used for its construction, and the specific environment in which it operates. Specific examples of learning systems are described in terms of the model. Author

Selecting corpus-semantic models for neurolinguistic decoding,"Brian Murphy, Partha Talukdar, Tom Mitchell",2012,,,,114-123,,"Neurosemantics aims to learn the mapping between concepts and the neural activity which they elicit during neuroimaging experiments. Different approaches have been used to represent individual concepts, but current state-of-the-art techniques require extensive manual intervention to scale to arbitrary words and domains. To overcome this challenge, we initiate a systematic comparison of automatically-derived corpus representations, based on various types of textual co-occurrence. We find that dependency parse-based features are the most effective, achieving accuracies similar to the leading semi-manual approaches and higher than any published for a corpus-based model. We also find that simple word features enriched with directional information provide a close-tooptimal solution at much lower computational cost.",83회,"Selecting corpus-semantic models for neurolinguistic decoding

Identifying autism from neural representations of social interactions: neurocognitive markers of autism,"Marcel Adam Just, Vladimir L Cherkassky, Augusto Buchweitz, Timothy A Keller, Tom M Mitchell",2014/12/2,,9,12,e113879,Public Library of Science,"Autism is a psychiatric/neurological condition in which alterations in social interaction (among other symptoms) are diagnosed by behavioral psychiatric methods. The main goal of this study was to determine how the neural representations and meanings of social concepts (such as to insult) are altered in autism. A second goal was to determine whether these alterations can serve as neurocognitive markers of autism. The approach is based on previous advances in fMRI analysis methods that permit (a) the identification of a concept, such as the thought of a physical object, from its fMRI pattern, and (b) the ability to assess the semantic content of a concept from its fMRI pattern. These factor analysis and machine learning methods were applied to the fMRI activation patterns of 17 adults with high-functioning autism and matched controls, scanned while thinking about 16 social interactions. One prominent neural representation factor that emerged (manifested mainly in posterior midline regions) was related to self-representation, but this factor was present only for the control participants, and was near-absent in the autism group. Moreover, machine learning algorithms classified individuals as autistic or control with 97% accuracy from their fMRI neurocognitive markers. The findings suggest that psychiatric alterations of thought can begin to be biologically understood by assessing the form and content of the altered thought’s underlying brain activation patterns.",79회,"Identifying autism from neural representations of social interactions: neurocognitive markers of autism

Integrating inductive neural network learning and explanation-based learning,"Sebastian B Thrun, Tom M Mitchell",1993/7,,,,930-936,,"Many researchers have noted the importance of combining inductive and analytical learning, yet we still lack combined learning methods that are e ective in practice. We present here a learning method that combines explanation-based learning from a previously learned approximate domain theory, together with inductive learning from observations. This method, called explanation-based neural network learning (EBNN), is based on a neural network representation of domain knowledge. Explanations are constructed by chaining together inferences from multiple neural networks. In contrast with symbolic approaches to explanation-based learning which extract weakest preconditions from the explanation, EBNN extracts the derivatives of the target concept with respect to the training example features. These derivatives summarize the dependencies within the explanation, and are used to bias the inductive learning of the target concept. Experimental results on a simulated robot control task show that EBNN requires signi cantly fewer training examples than standard inductive learning. Furthermore, the method is shown to be robust to errors in the domain theory, operating e ectively over a broad spectrum from very strong to very weak domain theories.",75회,"Integrating inductive neural network learning and explanation-based learning

Language-aware truth assessment of fact candidates,"Ndapandula Nakashole, Tom Mitchell",2014/6,,,,1009-1019,,"This paper introduces FactChecker, language-aware approach to truth-finding. FactChecker differs from prior approaches in that it does not rely on iterative peer voting, instead it leverages language to infer believability of fact candidates. In particular, FactChecker makes use of linguistic features to detect if a given source objectively states facts or is speculative and opinionated. To ensure that fact candidates mentioned in similar sources have similar believability, FactChecker augments objectivity with a co-mention score to compute the overall believability score of a fact candidate. Our experiments on various datasets show that FactChecker yields higher accuracy than existing approaches.",73회,"Language-aware truth assessment of fact candidates

Instructable intelligent personal agent,"Amos Azaria, Jayant Krishnamurthy, Tom Mitchell",2016/3/5,,30,1,,,"Unlike traditional machine learning methods, humans often learn from natural language instruction. As users become increasingly accustomed to interacting with mobile devices using speech, their interest in instructing these devices in natural language is likely to grow. We introduce our Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA), an intelligent personal agent that users can teach to perform new action sequences to achieve new commands, using solely natural language interaction. LIA uses a CCG semantic parser to ground the semantics of each command in terms of primitive executable procedures defining sensors and effectors of the agent. Given a natural language command that LIA does not understand, it prompts the user to explain how to achieve the command through a sequence of steps, also specified in natural language. A novel lexicon induction algorithm enables LIA to generalize across taught commands, eg, having been taught how to"" forward an email to Alice,"" LIA can correctly interpret the command"" forward this email to Bob."" A user study involving email tasks demonstrates that users voluntarily teach LIA new commands, and that these taught commands significantly reduce task completion time. These results demonstrate the potential of natural language instruction as a significant, under-explored paradigm for machine learning.",71회,"Instructable intelligent personal agent

Contextual parameter generation for universal neural machine translation,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Mrinmaya Sachan, Graham Neubig, Tom Mitchell",2018/8/26,,,,,,"We propose a simple modification to existing neural machine translation (NMT) models that enables using a single universal model to translate between multiple languages while allowing for language specific parameterization, and that can also be used for domain adaptation. Our approach requires no changes to the model architecture of a standard NMT system, but instead introduces a new component, the contextual parameter generator (CPG), that generates the parameters of the system (eg, weights in a neural network). This parameter generator accepts source and target language embeddings as input, and generates the parameters for the encoder and the decoder, respectively. The rest of the model remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. We show how this simple modification enables the system to use monolingual data for training and also perform zero-shot translation. We further show it is able to surpass state-of-the-art performance for both the IWSLT-15 and IWSLT-17 datasets and that the learned language embeddings are able to uncover interesting relationships between languages.",69회,"Contextual parameter generation for universal neural machine translation

Detecting Significant Multidimensional Spatial Clusters.,"Daniel B Neill, Andrew W Moore, Francisco Pereira, Tom M Mitchell",2004/1/1,,,,969-976,,"Assume a uniform, multidimensional grid of bivariate data, where each cell of the grid has a count ci and a baseline bi. Our goal is to find spatial regions (d-dimensional rectangles) where the ci are significantly higher than expected given bi. We focus on two applications: detection of clusters of disease cases from epidemiological data (emergency department visits, over-the-counter drug sales), and discovery of regions of increased brain activity corresponding to given cognitive tasks (from fMRI data). Each of these problems can be solved using a spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff, 1997), where we compute the maximum of a likelihood ratio statistic over all spatial regions, and find the significance of this region by randomization. However, computing the scan statistic for all spatial regions is generally computationally infeasible, so we introduce a novel fast spatial scan algorithm, generalizing the 2D scan algorithm of (Neill and Moore, 2004) to arbitrary dimensions. Our new multidimensional multiresolution algorithm allows us to find spatial clusters up to 1400x faster than the naive spatial scan, without any loss of accuracy.",68회,"Detecting Significant Multidimensional Spatial Clusters.

VSMs are typically created using a large text corpora, and so represent word semantics as observed in text. We present a new algorithm (JNNSE) that can incorporate a measure of semantics not previously used to create VSMs: brain activation data recorded while people read words. The resulting model takes advantage of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of corpus and brain activation data to give a more complete representation of semantics. Evaluations show that the model 1) matches a behavioral measure of semantics more closely, 2) can be used to predict corpus data for unseen words and 3) has predictive power that generalizes across brain imaging technologies and across subjects. We believe that the model is thus a more faithful representation of mental vocabularies.",67회,"Interpretable semantic vectors from a joint model of brain-and text-based meaning

Aligning context-based statistical models of language with brain activity during reading,"Leila Wehbe, Ashish Vaswani, Kevin Knight, Tom Mitchell",2014/10,,,,233-243,,"Many statistical models for natural language processing exist, including context-based neural networks that (1) model the previously seen context as a latent feature vector,(2) integrate successive words into the context using some learned representation (embedding), and (3) compute output probabilities for incoming words given the context. On the other hand, brain imaging studies have suggested that during reading, the brain (a) continuously builds a context from the successive words and every time it encounters a word it (b) fetches its properties from memory and (c) integrates it with the previous context with a degree of effort that is inversely proportional to how probable the word is. This hints to a parallelism between the neural networks and the brain in modeling context (1 and a), representing the incoming words (2 and b) and integrating it (3 and c). We explore this parallelism to better understand the brain processes and the neural networks representations. We study the alignment between the latent vectors used by neural networks and brain activity observed via Magnetoencephalography (MEG) when subjects read a story. For that purpose we apply the neural network to the same text the subjects are reading, and explore the ability of these three vector representations to predict the observed word-by-word brain activity.
Our novel results show that: before a new word i is read, brain activity is well predicted by the neural network latent representation of context and the predictability decreases as the brain integrates the word and changes its own representation of context.

Quantitative modeling of the neural representation of objects: how semantic feature norms can account for fMRI activation,"Kai-min Kevin Chang, Tom Mitchell, Marcel Adam Just",2011/5/15,,56,2,716-727,Academic Press,"Recent multivariate analyses of fMRI activation have shown that discriminative classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) are capable of decoding fMRI-sensed neural states associated with the visual presentation of categories of various objects.

In this study, we propose a generative classifier that models the hidden factors that underpin the neural representation of objects, using a multivariate multiple linear regression model. The results indicate that object features derived from an independent behavioral feature norming study can explain a significant portion of the systematic variance in the neural activity observed in an object-contemplation task.

Competence-based curriculum learning for neural machine translation,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Otilia Stretcu, Graham Neubig, Barnabas Poczos, Tom M Mitchell",2019/3/23,,,,,,"Current state-of-the-art NMT systems use large neural networks that are not only slow to train, but also often require many heuristics and optimization tricks, such as specialized learning rate schedules and large batch sizes. This is undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time, reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and results in overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way of deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training examples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing NMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines. We show that our framework can help improve the training time and the performance of both recurrent neural network models and Transformers, achieving up to a 70% decrease in training time, while at the same time obtaining accuracy improvements of up to 2.2 BLEU.",62회,"Competence-based curriculum learning for neural machine translation

We consider the problem of concept learning from natural language explanations, and a small number of labeled examples of the concept.

Solving this problem involves both learning to interpret open ended natural language statements, and learning the concept itself. We present a joint model for (1) language interpretation (semantic parsing) and (2) concept learning (classification) that does not require labeling statements with logical forms. Instead, the model prefers discriminative interpretations of statements in context of observable features of the data as a weak signal for parsing. On a dataset of email-related concepts, our approach yields across-the-board improvements in classification performance, with a 30% relative improvement in F1 score over competitive methods in the low data regime.",59회,"Joint concept learning and semantic parsing from natural language explanations

Estimating accuracy from unlabeled data,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Avrim Blum, Tom Mitchell",2014,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,"We consider the question of how unlabeled data can be used to estimate the true accuracy of learned classifiers. This is an important question for any autonomous learning system that must estimate its accuracy without supervision, and also when classifiers trained from one data distribution must be applied to a new distribution (e.g., document classifiers trained on one text corpus are to be applied to a second corpus). We first show how to estimate error rates exactly from unlabeled data when given a collection of competing classifiers that make independent errors, based on the agreement rates between subsets of these classifiers. We further show that even when the competing classifiers do not make independent errors, both their accuracies and error dependencies can be estimated by making certain relaxed assumptions. Experiments on two data real-world data sets produce estimates within a few percent of the true accuracy, using solely unlabeled data.

Acquiring temporal constraints between relations,"Partha Pratim Talukdar, Derry Wijaya, Tom Mitchell",2012/10/29,,,,992-1001,,"We consider the problem of automatically acquiring knowledge about the typical temporal orderings among relations (eg, actedIn (person, film) typically occurs before wonPrize (film, award)), given only a database of known facts (relation instances) without time information, and a large document collection.

We propose a family of algorithms based on this conjecture, utilizing a corpus of 890m dependency parsed sentences to obtain verbs that represent relations of interest, and utilizing Wikipedia documents to gather statistics on narrative order of verb mentions.

Which noun phrases denote which concepts?,"Jayant Krishnamurthy, Tom Mitchell",2011/6,,,,570-580,,"Resolving polysemy and synonymy is required for high-quality information extraction. We present ConceptResolver, a component for the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL)(Carlson et al., 2010) that handles both phenomena by identifying the latent concepts that noun phrases refer to. ConceptResolver performs both word sense induction and synonym resolution on relations extracted from text using an ontology and a small amount of labeled data. Domain knowledge (the ontology) guides concept creation by defining a set of possible semantic types for concepts. Word sense induction is performed by inferring a set of semantic types for each noun phrase. Synonym detection exploits redundant information to train several domain-specific synonym classifiers in a semi-supervised fashion. When ConceptResolver is run on NELL’s knowledge base, 87% of the word senses it creates correspond to real-world concepts, and 85% of noun phrases that it suggests refer to the same concept are indeed synonyms.",42회,"Which noun phrases denote which concepts?

Inferring pairwise regulatory relationships from multiple time series datasets,"Yanxin Shi, Tom Mitchell, Ziv Bar-Joseph",2007/3/15,,23,6,755-763,Oxford University Press,"Motivation: Time series expression experiments have emerged as a popular method for studying a wide range of biological systems under a variety of conditions. One advantage of such data is the ability to infer regulatory relationships using time lag analysis. However, such analysis in a single experiment may result in many false positives due to the small number of time points and the large number of genes. Extending these methods to simultaneously analyze several time series datasets is challenging since under different experimental conditions biological systems may behave faster or slower making it hard to rely on the actual duration of the experiment.

This chapter describes an autonomous robot agent called Theo-Agent that initially constructs explicit plans to solve new problems in its domain and converges to an agent that reacts directly to the features of its environment with an appropriate action. As the rules take into account the agent's multiple goals, why the agent has chosen to attend to its current goal, conditions under which the plan will satisfy the current goal, and the necessity of the action to achieving the agent's goal, they produce reactive, opportunistic decisions equivalent to those that would be produced by continually re-invoking costly planning methods. Theo-Agent has been used to learn such rules for a simulated blocks-world robot, a simulated thermostat, and an operating mobile robot.

Vector space semantic parsing: A framework for compositional vector space models,"Jayant Krishnamurthy, Tom Mitchell",2013/8,,,,1-10,,"We present vector space semantic parsing (VSSP), a framework for learning compositional models of vector space semantics. Our framework uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to define a correspondence between syntactic categories and semantic representations, which are vectors and functions on vectors. The complete correspondence is a direct consequence of minimal assumptions about the semantic representations of basic syntactic categories (eg, nouns are vectors), and CCG’s tight coupling of syntax and semantics. Furthermore, this correspondence permits nonuniform semantic representations and more expressive composition operations than previous work. VSSP builds a CCG semantic parser respecting this correspondence; this semantic parser parses text into lambda calculus formulas that evaluate to vector space representations. In these formulas, the meanings of words are represented by parameters that can be trained in a task-specific fashion. We present experiments using noun-verbnoun and adverb-adjective-noun phrases which demonstrate that VSSP can learn composition operations that RNN (Socher et al., 2011) and MV-RNN (Socher et al., 2012) cannot.",35회,"Vector space semantic parsing: A framework for compositional vector space models

Our approach directly converts a sentence’s syntactic CCG parse into a logical form containing predicates derived from the words in the sentence, assigning each word a consistent semantics across sentences. This logical form is evaluated against a learned probabilistic database that defines a distribution over denotations for each textual predicate. A training phase produces this probabilistic database using a corpus of entity-linked text and probabilistic matrix factorization with a …",33회,"Learning a compositional semantics for freebase with an open predicate vocabulary

Inferring Ongoing Activities of Workstation Users by Clustering Email.,"Yifen Huang, Dinesh Govindaraju, Tom M Mitchell, Vitor Rocha de Carvalho, William W Cohen",2004/7,,,,,,"We are interested in automatically discovering the key ongoing activities of a workstation user, such as committees to which she belongs, writing projects in which she is involved, etc., based on the contents of her workstation. The thesis underlying our research is that this collection of user activities can be automatically inferred from the variety of data available on most users’ workstations, including their emails, files, online calendar, and history of web page accesses. If such activities could be inferred, this knowledge about the user's activities could be used in a variety of ways to support the user. For example, it could be used to cross-index email, calendar events, files, and web accesses according to activity, or to produce a'briefing folder'for each meeting on the user's calendar (ie, a folder containing emails, files, etc., relevant to the activity associated with this meeting).
In this short paper we describe our initial research on inferring such activities by examining only the user's email. In particular, we describe here a variety of unsupervised clustering methods designed specifically for emails, and present experimental results showing that these algorithms often produce clusters of emails aligned with distinct user activities. Also, we present a variety of representations to summarize a cluster, which is targeted to interpret the meanings of a given cluster to the user.",33회,"Inferring Ongoing Activities of Workstation Users by Clustering Email.

Previous work has studied various rule-or learning-based approaches designed for specific types of data manipulation. In this work, we propose a new method that supports learning different manipulation schemes with the same gradient-based algorithm. Our approach builds upon a recent connection of supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL), and adapts an off-the-shelf reward learning algorithm from RL for joint data manipulation learning and model training. Different parameterization of the"" data reward"" function instantiates different manipulation schemes. We showcase data augmentation that learns a text transformation network, and data weighting that dynamically adapts the data sample importance.

Sense discovery via co-clustering on images and text,"Xinlei Chen, Alan Ritter, Abhinav Gupta, Tom Mitchell",2015,,,,5298-5306,,"We present a co-clustering framework that can be used to discover multiple semantic and visual senses of a given Noun Phrase (NP). Unlike traditional clustering approaches which assume a one-to-one mapping between the clusters in the text-based feature space and the visual space, we adopt a one-to-many mapping between the two spaces. This is primarily because each semantic sense (concept) can correspond to different visual senses due to viewpoint and appearance variations. Our structure-EM style optimization not only extracts the multiple senses in both semantic and visual feature space, but also discovers the mapping between the senses. We introduce a challenging dataset (CMU Polysemy-30) for this problem consisting of 30 NPs (5600 labeled instances out of 22 K total instances).

The difficulty with scaling up to more complex tasks is that inductive learning methods require a very large number of training examples in order to generalize correctly from complex sensor data. This chapter proposes an approach to overcoming this difficulty, by relying on previously learned information to augment the available training data. In particular, we consider the task faced by a mobile robot learning to recognize new objects within an already-familiar environment. Because the robot has previously operated within this environment (here the corridors of a particular building), it has already had the opportunity to learn certain regularities that can be useful in subsequent learning tasks.

This chapter discusses an approach to solve the problem of developing and maintaining the knowledge base by constructing systems that learn from their users. Learning apprentices offer a potential solution to all difficulties. To the degree that it can observe and learn from the decisions of its users, a learning apprentice will be able to infer the desired program specification by itself as well as adapt to the idiosyncratic and changing specifications of different users. A number of attempts have been made to develop learning apprentice systems in various application domains. LEAP provides interactive advice on how to decompose Boolean circuit specifications into circuit sub modules, resulting eventually in a gate-level circuit design. LEAP collects training examples whenever its advice is accepted or overridden by the user, and it is able to learn new tactics for circuit decomposition from these …",29회,"Interfaces that learn: A learning apprentice for calendar management

Estimating accuracy from unlabeled data: A probabilistic logic approach,"Emmanouil A Platanios, Hoifung Poon, Tom M Mitchell, Eric Horvitz",2017/5/19,,,,,,"We propose an efficient method to estimate the accuracy of classifiers using only unlabeled data. We consider a setting with multiple classification problems where the target classes may be tied together through logical constraints. For example, a set of classes may be mutually exclusive, meaning that a data instance can belong to at most one of them. The proposed method is based on the intuition that:(i) when classifiers agree, they are more likely to be correct, and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction that violates the constraints, at least one classifier must be making an error. Experiments on four real-world data sets produce accuracy estimates within a few percent of the true accuracy, using solely unlabeled data. Our models also outperform existing state-of-the-art solutions in both estimating accuracies, and combining multiple classifier outputs. The results emphasize the utility of logical constraints in estimating accuracy, thus validating our intuition.",28회,"Estimating accuracy from unlabeled data: A probabilistic logic approach

Firstly, activity-centred environmental design is introduced. With this approach potential design users evolve form gradually on the basis of their activities through use of modular scale models. Secondly, perceptually based designs are discussed. With designs of this type, experience itself becomes the focus of the designing; physical form may or may not be a part of the outcome of the design process in this case, but in any event forms are of secondary importance to the perceptual effects which they give rise to.

Documents and dependencies: an exploration of vector space models for semantic composition,"Alona Fyshe, Brian Murphy, Partha Talukdar, Tom Mitchell",2013/8,,,,84-93,,"In most previous research on distributional semantics, Vector Space Models (VSMs) of words are built either from topical information (eg, documents in which a word is present), or from syntactic/semantic types of words (eg, dependency parse links of a word in sentences), but not both. In this paper, we explore the utility of combining these two representations to build VSM for the task of semantic composition of adjective-noun phrases. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we find that even though a type-based VSM is effective for semantic composition, it is often outperformed by a VSM built using a combination of topic-and type-based statistics. We also introduce a new evaluation task wherein we predict the composed vector representation of a phrase from the brain activity of a human subject reading that phrase.

Learning analytically and inductively,"Tom M Mitchell, Sebastian B Thrun",1995,,,,85-110,Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publisher,"Learning is a fundamental component of intelligence, and a key consideration in designing cognitive architectures such as Soar [Laird et al., 1986]. This chapter considers the question of what constitutes an appropriate general-purpose learning mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that might explain and reproduce the rich variety of learning capabilities of humans, ranging from learning perceptual-motor skills such as how to ride a bicycle, to learning highly cognitive tasks such as how to play chess.
Research on learning in fields such as cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, and statistics has led to the identification of two distinct classes of learning methods: inductive and analytic. Inductive methods, such as neural network Backpropagation, learn general laws by finding statistical correlations and regularities among a large set of training examples. In contrast, analytical methods, such as Explanation-Based Learning, acquire general laws from many fewer training examples. They rely instead on prior knowledge to analyze individual training examples in detail, then use this analysis to distinguish relevant example features from the irrelevant.",26회,"Learning analytically and inductively

Developing handwriting-based Intelligent Tutors to enhance mathematics learning,"Lisa Anthony, Jennifer Mankoff, Tom Mitchell, Mark Gross",2008/10/9,,,,,,"Mathematics is a topic in American education in which students lag behind their international peers, yet it is a key building block for high-performing careers in science, computers, and engineering. Intelligent tutoring systems have been helping to narrow this gap by providing students with opportunities to practice problem-solving and receive detailed feedback along the way, letting them work at their own pace and practice specific concepts. Prior to this work, intelligent tutors for math have been shown to improve student performance one standard-deviation above traditional classroom instruction [35]. This dissertation explores ways to improve this effect via the use of alternative input modalities, specifically: handwriting input, and investigates the impact on learning in the domain of algebra equation solving.
This dissertation shows that handwriting provides usability benefits in that speed of entry increases, user error decreases, and user satisfaction increases. Furthermore, it shows that handwriting may also provide learning benefits: students solving the same problems by handwriting as others who are typing experience a faster learning rate. Specific math advantages of using handwriting are: a reduction in extraneous cognitive load due to the affordance of handwriting for more direct manipulation, and improved support for the two-dimensional spatial information which is inherently meaningful in mathematics (eg, vertical fraction notation). This dissertation investigates these factors and their impact.",22회,"Developing handwriting-based Intelligent Tutors to enhance mathematics learning

Hierarchical latent dictionaries for models of brain activation,"Alona Fyshe, Emily Fox, David Dunson, Tom Mitchell",2012/3/21,,,,409-421,PMLR,"In this work, we propose a hierarchical latent dictionary approach to estimate the time-varying mean and covariance of a process for which we have only limited noisy samples. We fully leverage the limited sample size and redundancy in sensor measurements by transferring knowledge through a hierarchy of lower dimensional latent processes. As a case study, we utilize Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of brain activity to identify the word being viewed by a human subject. Specifically, we identify the word category for a single noisy MEG recording, when given only limited noisy samples on which to train.",20회,"Hierarchical latent dictionaries for models of brain activation

Continuous hidden process model for time series expression experiments,"Yanxin Shi, Michael Klustein, Itamar Simon, Tom Mitchell, Ziv Bar-Joseph",2007/7/1,,23,13,i459-i467,Oxford University Press,"Motivation: When analyzing expression experiments, researchers are often interested in identifying the set of biological processes that are up-or down-regulated under the experimental condition studied. Current approaches, including clustering expression profiles and averaging the expression profiles of genes known to participate in specific processes, fail to provide an accurate estimate of the activity levels of many biological processes.
Results: We introduce a probabilistic continuous hidden process Model (CHPM) for time series expression data. CHPM can simultaneously determine the most probable assignment of genes to processes and the level of activation of these processes over time. To estimate model parameters, CHPM uses multiple time series datasets and incorporates prior biological knowledge.

Using machine learning to detect cognitive states across multiple subjects,"Xuerui Wang, Tom M Mitchell, Rebecca Hutchinson",2003,,,,,,"Is it feasible to train cross-subject classifiers to decode the cognitive states of human subjects based on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data observed over a single time interval? If so, these trained classifiers could be used as virtual sensors to detect cognitive states that apply across multiple human subjects. This problem is relevant to experimental research in cognitive science and to diagnosis of mental processes in patients with brain injuries. The biggest obstacle to training inter-subject classifiers on fMRI data is anatomical variability among subjects. We describe two approaches to overcoming this difficulty. The first approach takes advantage of the anatomically defined Region of Interest (ROI) as a basis for spatially abstracting the data, and the second one transforms the data from different subjects into Talairach-Tournoux coordinates. In particular, we present two fMRI case studies in which we have successfully trained cross-subject classifier to distinguish cognitive states such as (1) whether the human subject is looking at a picture or a sentence describing that picture, and (2) whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or unambiguous sentence.",20회,"Using machine learning to detect cognitive states across multiple subjects

Experiments in robot learning,"Matthew T Mason, Alan D Christiansen, Tom M Mitchell",1989/1/1,Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Machine Learning,,,141-145,Morgan Kaufmann,"Publisher Summary
This chapter reviews two robots that can learn how the world behaves in, and improves their own performance over time based on the information gathered. The underlying architecture of such robots would be of the abstract agent variety and implemented in CommonLisp. The abstract agent defines a framework for defining and testing different learning agents. Also, the architecture of the abstract agent allows a new agent to be created by plugging in a new module or recombining old modules. The experimental task domain defined for the robots is the operation of a tilting tray. A robotic manipulator holds a square tray, bounded by four vertical walls, which may be tilted at any angle desired. An object, typically a square block, slides freely in the tray. By a judicious choice of tilting sequence, the robot is able to position the object in the tray. The chief complication of the tilting-tray occurs when the …",20회,"Experiments in robot learning

Representations for reasoning about digital circuits,"Tom M Mitchell, Lou Steinberg, Reid G Smith, Howard Jacobs, Pat Schooley",1981/7/1,,,,,RUTGERS-THE STATE UNIV NEW BRUNSWICK NJ DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE,"We are interested in developing programs that reason about digital electronic circuits, in order to design, redesign, and debug them. The first step toward developing such programs is to determine a useful way of representing the design and operation of circuits. A useful representation must make apparent the roles of various circuit components in implementing the overall circuit function, and must allow a program to reason about the operation of the circuit at various levels of abstraction. This paper summarizes our efforts to develop such a representation. This work is closely related to other AI work on representing plans and on representing and reasoning about complex physical processes.

The memory and computational complexity associated with this step grow as a quadratic and cubic function of the problem dimension (the number of samples / features), respectively.

In this study, we investigate how humans comprehend adjective-noun phrases (eg strong dog) while their neural activity is recorded. Classification analysis shows that the distributed pattern of neural activity contains sufficient signal to decode differences among phrases. Furthermore, vector-based semantic models can explain a significant portion of systematic variance in the observed neural activity. Multiplicative composition models of the two-word phrase outperform additive models, consistent with the assumption that people use adjectives to modify the meaning of the noun, rather than conjoining the meaning of the adjective and noun.",19회,"Quantitative modeling of the neural representation of adjective-noun phrases to account for fMRI activation

Exploring hierarchical user feedback in email clustering,"Yifen Huang, Tom M Mitchell",2008,,,,,,"Organizing data into hierarchies is natural for humans. However, there is little work in machine learning that explores human-machine mixed-initiative approaches to organizing data into hierarchical clusters. In this paper we consider mixed-initiative clustering of a user's email, in which the machine produces (initial and re-trained) hierarchical clusterings of email, and the user iteratively reviews and edits the hierarchical clustering, providing constraints on the next iteration of clustering. Key challenges include (a) determining types of feedback that users will find natural to provide,(b) developing hierarchical clustering and retraining algorithms capable of accepting these types of user feedback,(c) determining the correspondence between two hierarchical structures, and (d) understanding how user behavior changes during a single feedback session and designing machine strategies that change with the user. Preliminary experimental results of two cases shows that under ideal conditions, this mixed-initiative approach requires only 6 minutes of user effort to achieve email clusterings comparable to those requiring 13 to 15 minutes of manual editing efforts.",17회,"Exploring hierarchical user feedback in email clustering

Understanding language-elicited EEG data by predicting it from a fine-tuned language model,"Dan Schwartz, Tom Mitchell",2019/4/2,,,,,,"Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of brain activity taken while participants read or listen to language are widely used within the cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics communities as a tool to study language comprehension. Several time-locked stereotyped EEG responses to word-presentations--known collectively as event-related potentials (ERPs)--are thought to be markers for semantic or syntactic processes that take place during comprehension. However, the characterization of each individual ERP in terms of what features of a stream of language trigger the response remains controversial. Improving this characterization would make ERPs a more useful tool for studying language comprehension. We take a step towards better understanding the ERPs by fine-tuning a language model to predict them. This new approach to analysis shows for the first time that all of the ERPs are predictable from embeddings of a stream of language. Prior work has only found two of the ERPs to be predictable. In addition to this analysis, we examine which ERPs benefit from sharing parameters during joint training. We find that two pairs of ERPs previously identified in the literature as being related to each other benefit from joint training, while several other pairs of ERPs that benefit from joint training are suggestive of potential relationships. Extensions of this analysis that further examine what kinds of information in the model embeddings relate to each ERP have the potential to elucidate the processes involved in human language comprehension.",15회,"Understanding language-elicited EEG data by predicting it from a fine-tuned language model

Mapping verbs in different languages to knowledge base relations using web text as interlingua,"Derry Tanti Wijaya, Tom Mitchell",2016/6,,,,818-827,,"In recent years many knowledge bases (KBs) have been constructed, yet there is not yet a verb resource that maps to these growing KB resources. A resource that maps verbs in different languages to KB relations would be useful for extracting facts from text into the KBs, and to aid alignment and integration of knowledge across different KBs and languages. Such a multi-lingual verb resource would also be useful for tasks such as machine translation and machine reading. In this paper, we present a scalable approach to automatically construct such a verb resource using a very large web text corpus as a kind of interlingua to relate verb phrases to KB relations. Given a text corpus in any language and any KB, it can produce a mapping of that language’s verb phrases to the KB relations. Experiments with the English NELL KB and ClueWeb corpus show that the learned English verb-to-relation mapping is effective for extracting relation instances from English text. When applied to a Portuguese NELL KB and a Portuguese text corpus, the same method automatically constructs a verb resource in Portuguese that is effective for extracting relation instances from Portuguese text.",15회,"Mapping verbs in different languages to knowledge base relations using web text as interlingua

A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints.,"Radu Stefan Niculescu, Tom M Mitchell, R Bharat Rao",2007/1/1,,,,155-160,,"The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. Domain knowledge can come in many forms. For example, expert knowledge about the relevance of variables relative to a certain problem can help perform better feature selection. Domain knowledge about the conditional independence relationships among variables can help learning of the Bayesian Network structure.
This paper considers a different type of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian Networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that comes in the form of inequality constraints among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian Network with known structure. These parameter constraints are incorporated into learning procedures for Bayesian Networks, by formulating this task as a constrained optimization problem. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of closed form Maximum Likelihood parameter estimators in the above setting.",15회,"A Theoretical Framework for Learning Bayesian Networks with Parameter Inequality Constraints.

Living design: The daoist way of building,"C Thomas Mitchell, Jiangmei Wu",1998/5/1,,,,,McGraw-Hill Companies,"Over the course of the past few decades interest in Eastern philosophy and thought, and the ways in which they can influence how we do things in the West, has grown markedly.

No matter how tenuous the connection between the Eastern philosophies and the Western activities that they are conjoined with, the premise of each of these books is that there is a wisdom present in the traditions of the East that is missing in present-day Western society—a wisdom that, it is hoped, can be tapped in order to make the activities we engage in more meaningful. This book is the product of a collaboration exploring the relevance and applicability of Eastern philosophical ideas to design and architecture in the West. The partnership of myself and Jiangmei Wu occurred by chance, but was fortuitous. At the time we met, I was completing my first book, Redefining designing: From form to experience, in which I set out the shortcomings of recent trends in Western architecture and design and argued for a new, more user responsive approach to designing. Mei, having completed an undergraduate degree in architecture in China, was pursuing a master's degree in interior design because it was her intention to adapt her skills in order to practice architecture and design in the United States. I'm afraid I ruined things for her somewhat by my insistence that the processes of Western design are fundamentally flawed and by suggesting …",15회,"Living design: The daoist way of building

Goal directed learning,"Tom M Mitchell, R Keller",1983/6/22,,,,117-118,"Allerton House, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","1 Introduction Much research on learning has focussed on methods for empirical generalization for learning descriptions of general concepts from training examples. This generalization problem is usually formulated so that the only information available to the learner is the set of input training instances, and some a priori biases for prefering certain generalizations over others. We argue here that this kind of formulation of the generalization problem is unrealistic and overly difficult--that when humans face such generalization problems, they typically have some goal, or purpose for attempting to learn, a particular concept Our main point is that explicit knowledge of this learning goal, and of the context in which it was formulated, can provide very strong guidance for learning.",15회,"Goal directed learning

Scoup-smt: Scalable coupled sparse matrix-tensor factorization,"Evangelos E Papalexakis, Tom M Mitchell, Nicholas D Sidiropoulos, Christos Faloutsos, Partha Pratim Talukdar, Brian Murphy",2013/2/28,,,,,,"How can we correlate neural activity in the human brain as it responds to words, with behavioral data expressed as answers to questions about these same words? In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. We show that this is an instance of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem. We propose Scoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend Scoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply Scoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of Scoup-SMT, by applying it on a Facebook dataset (users, friends, wall-postings); there, Scoup-SMT spots spammer-like anomalies.",14회,"Scoup-smt: Scalable coupled sparse matrix-tensor factorization

Office automation systems that are “programmed” by their users,"Siegfried Bocionek, Tom M Mitchell",1993,,,,214-219,"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","To be highly useful, office automation systems require customization to individual users, work environments, and tasks. We consider the question of whether office automation systems can be developed that allow users who are not skilled programmers to easily “program”, or customize, these tools themselves. In other words, can we deploy very general, non-customized programs that can be extended and adapted during usage? Besides the well-known knowledge acquisition and automated learning methods we propose an approach called dialog-based learning (DBL), that allows the user to teach the system directly while performing the task. It acquires knowledge through a dialog in which the user both illustrates the procedure using a grounded example, and provides instructions about how to perform the task in the general case.

From data to knowledge to action: A global enabler for the 21st century,"Eric Horvitz, Tom Mitchell",2020/7/31,,,,,,"A confluence of advances in the computer and mathematical sciences has unleashed unprecedented capabilities for enabling true evidence-based decision making. These capabilities are making possible the large-scale capture of data and the transformation of that data into insights and recommendations in support of decisions about challenging problems in science, society, and government. Key advances include jumps in the availability of rich streams of data, precipitous drops in the cost of storing and retrieving massive amounts of data, exponential increases in computing power and memory, and jumps in the prowess of methods for performing machine learning and reasoning. These advances have come together to create an inflection point in our ability to harness large amounts of data for generating insights and guiding decision making. The shift of commerce, science, education, art, and entertainment to the web makes available unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured databases about human activities-much of it available to anyone who wishes to mine it for insights. In the sciences, new evidential paradigms and sensing technologies are making available great quantities of data, via use of fundamentally new kinds of low-cost sensors (eg, genomic microarrays) or through viewers that provide unprecedented scope and resolution. The data pose a huge opportunity for data-centric analyses. To date, we have only scratched the surface of the potential for learning from these large-scale data sets.

The first group of methods relies on the expression levels of TFs, assuming that the activity of a TF is highly correlated with its mRNA abundance. The second treats the activity level as unobserved and infers it from the expression of the genes that the TF regulates. While both types of methods were successfully applied, each suffers from drawbacks that limit their accuracy. For the first set, the assumption that mRNA levels are correlated with activity is violated for many TFs due to post-transcriptional modifications. For the second, the expression level of a TF which might be informative is completely ignored.

Graphical models like HMMs, DBNs and Module Networks use different forms of Parameter Sharing to reduce the variance in the parameter estimates. The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical approach for learning in presence of several other types of Parameter Related Domain Knowledge that go beyond the ones in the above models.

“A Spousal Relation Begins with a Deletion of engage and Ends with an Addition of divorce”: Learning State Changing Verbs from Wikipedia Revision History,"Derry Tanti Wijaya, Ndapandula Nakashole, Tom Mitchell",2015/9,,,,518-523,,"Learning to determine when the timevarying facts of a Knowledge Base (KB) have to be updated is a challenging task. We propose to learn state changing verbs from Wikipedia edit history. When a state-changing event, such as a marriage or death, happens to an entity, the infobox on the entity’s Wikipedia page usually gets updated. At the same time, the article text may be updated with verbs either being added or deleted to reflect the changes made to the infobox. We use Wikipedia edit history to distantly supervise a method for automatically learning verbs and state changes. Additionally, our method uses constraints to effectively map verbs to infobox changes. We observe in our experiments that when state-changing verbs are added or deleted from an entity’s Wikipedia page text, we can predict the entity’s infobox updates with 88% precision and 76% recall. One compelling application of our verbs is to incorporate them as triggers in methods for updating existing KBs, which are currently mostly static.",12회,"“A Spousal Relation Begins with a Deletion of engage and Ends with an Addition of divorce”: Learning State Changing Verbs from Wikipedia Revision History

If so, these trained classifiers could be used as virtual sensors to detect hidden cognitive states of a subject, providing a key tool for experimental research in cognitive science and in diagnosis of mental processes in patients with brain injuries. Whereas much work has been done on fMRI data analysis methods that average together data collected from repeated stimuli over multiple episodes, little is known about the feasibility of training classifiers to decode cognitive states from single episodes. This paper presents several case studies in which we have successfully trained such classifiers. We explore the technical issues involved in training such single-episode classifiers, and discuss areas for future research. These case studies include training a classifier to determine (1) which of twelve semantic categories of words is being read by a human subject (eg, a word describing animals or one describing buildings),(2) whether or not a subject finds a sentence ambiguous, and (3) whether the subject is looking at a picture or at a sentence describing a picture.",12회,"Machine learning of fMRI virtual sensors of cognitive states

Although the attempted annihilation of European Jews by Hitler's Third Reich occurred between 1933 and 1945, the roots of anti-Semitism are at least two millennia old. Each of the book's nine chapters raises relevant questions regarding the Holocaust: its historical context, the factors, which made it possible, its victims and perpetrators, responses to it by individuals, groups, and nations, issues of gender, and the philosophical and theological implications.

These two mechanisms were investigated by examining neuronal-level spike (i.e. neuronal action potential) activities from the motor, somatosensory and parietal areas in two human participants.

Given a learner's history of past interactions with an ITS, a learner performance model estimates the current state of a learner's knowledge and predicts her future performance. The advent of increasingly large scale datasets has turned deep learning models for learner performance prediction into competitive alternatives to classical Markov process and logistic regression models. In an extensive empirical comparison on nine real-world datasets, we ask which approach makes the most accurate predictions and in what conditions. Logistic regression-with the right set of features-leads on datasets of moderate size or containing or containing a very large number of interactions per student, whereas Deep Knowledge Tracing leads on datasets of large size or where precise temporal information matters most. Markov process methods, like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, lag behind other approaches. We follow this analysis with ablation studies to determine what components of leading algorithms explain their performance and a discussion of model calibration (reliability), which is crucial for downstream applications of learner performance prediction models.",10회,"When is Deep Learning the Best Approach to Knowledge Tracing?

It is suggested that residues Trp-109, Thr-110 and Asp-113 are involved in ligand binding. Noradrenaline is successfully docked into this model, and the results of an INDO molecular orbital calculation on the complex indicate that a charge transfer interaction between Trp-109 and noradrenaline is possible.",10회,"A molecular modelling study of the interaction of noradrenaline with the β 2-adrenergic receptor

Learning to tag using noisy labels,"Edith Law, Burr Settles, Tom Mitchell",2010,,,,1-29,,"In order to organize and retrieve the ever growing collection of multimedia objects on the Web, many algorithms have been developed to automatically tag images, music and videos. One source of labeled data for training these algorithms are tags collected from the Web, via collaborative tagging websites (eg, Flickr, Last. FM and YouTube) or crowdsourcing applications (eg, human computation games and Mechanical Turk). A common approach is to use tags directly as labels for training algorithms in a supervised way. This approach is problematic, because the presence of synonyms and misspellings amongst the tags creates a label space that is overly fragmented, with a huge number of classes, many of which are sparse and semantically equivalent to one another. In this work, we investigate a method for training tagging algorithms using a reduced set of labels corresponding to topics derived from the tags. We show that our proposed method is comparable, in terms of annotation and retrieval performance, to the method of using tags directly as labels, while being more efficient to train (as there are fewer classes) and less wasteful (eliminating the need to discard tags that are associated with too few examples). We demonstrate our results using a dataset collected by a human computation game, called TagATune.",9회,"Learning to tag using noisy labels

"The Real McCain: Why Conservatives Don't Trust Him, and why Independents Shouldn't",Cliff Schecter,2008,,,,,PoliPointPress,"Thinking about voting for McCain? Read this book. Cliff Schecter's hard-hitting profile explores the gap between the public record of Senator John McCain and his media image. Drawing on a range of sources and adding his unique perspective and humor, Schecter guides the reader though McCain's long history of expedient flip-flops, especially on his signature issues of national security and campaign finance reform. Far from a straight-talking maverick, McCain emerges as a temperamental political chameleon who will do or say virtually anything to become president of the United States. On issue after issue-including the invasion and occupation of Iraq, torture, abortion, and gay rights-The Real McCain reveals a politician who started as a Goldwater Republican, experienced a brief period after sanity after his loss to George W. Bush in 2000, and began pandering to the very groups he challenged after deciding to run again in 2008.",9회,"The Real McCain: Why Conservatives Don't Trust Him, and why Independents Shouldn't

Learning to learn semantic parsers from natural language supervision,"Igor Labutov, Bishan Yang, Tom Mitchell",2019/2/22,,,,,,"As humans, we often rely on language to learn language. For example, when corrected in a conversation, we may learn from that correction, over time improving our language fluency. Inspired by this observation, we propose a learning algorithm for training semantic parsers from supervision (feedback) expressed in natural language. Our algorithm learns a semantic parser from users' corrections such as"" no, what I really meant was before his job, not after"", by also simultaneously learning to parse this natural language feedback in order to leverage it as a form of supervision. Unlike supervision with gold-standard logical forms, our method does not require the user to be familiar with the underlying logical formalism, and unlike supervision from denotation, it does not require the user to know the correct answer to their query. This makes our learning algorithm naturally scalable in settings where existing conversational logs are available and can be leveraged as training data. We construct a novel dataset of natural language feedback in a conversational setting, and show that our method is effective at learning a semantic parser from such natural language supervision.",8회,"Learning to learn semantic parsers from natural language supervision

Parsing Natural Language Conversations using Contextual Cues.,"Shashank Srivastava, Amos Azaria, Tom M Mitchell",2017/1/1,,,,4089-4095,,"In this work, we focus on semantic parsing of natural language conversations. Most existing methods for semantic parsing are based on understanding the semantics of a single sentence at a time. However, understanding conversations also requires an understanding of conversational context and discourse structure across sentences. We formulate semantic parsing of conversations as a structured prediction task, incorporating structural features that model the ‘flow of discourse’across sequences of utterances. We create a dataset for semantic parsing of conversations, consisting of 113 real-life sequences of interactions of human users with an automated email assistant. The data contains 4759 natural language statements paired with annotated logical forms. Our approach yields significant gains in performance over traditional semantic parsing.",8회,"Parsing Natural Language Conversations using Contextual Cues.

Efficient inference and learning in a large knowledge base: Reasoning with extracted information using a locally groundable first-order probabilistic logic,"William Yang Wang, Kathryn Mazaitis, Ni Lao, Tom Mitchell, William W Cohen",2014/4/12,,,,,,"One important challenge for probabilistic logics is reasoning with very large knowledge bases (KBs) of imperfect information, such as those produced by modern web-scale information extraction systems. One scalability problem shared by many probabilistic logics is that answering queries involves"" grounding"" the query---ie, mapping it to a propositional representation---and the size of a"" grounding"" grows with database size. To address this bottleneck, we present a first-order probabilistic language called ProPPR in which that approximate"" local groundings"" can be constructed in time independent of database size. Technically, ProPPR is an extension to stochastic logic programs (SLPs) that is biased towards short derivations; it is also closely related to an earlier relational learning algorithm called the path ranking algorithm (PRA). We show that the problem of constructing proofs for this logic is related to computation of personalized PageRank (PPR) on a linearized version of the proof space, and using on this connection, we develop a proveably-correct approximate grounding scheme, based on the PageRank-Nibble algorithm. Building on this, we develop a fast and easily-parallelized weight-learning algorithm for ProPPR. In experiments, we show that learning for ProPPR is orders magnitude faster than learning for Markov logic networks; that allowing mutual recursion (joint learning) in KB inference leads to improvements in performance; and that ProPPR can learn weights for a mutually recursive program with hundreds of clauses, which define scores of interrelated predicates, over a KB containing one million entities.",8회,"Efficient inference and learning in a large knowledge base: Reasoning with extracted information using a locally groundable first-order probabilistic logic

Explanationbased learning for mobile robot perception,"Tom M Mitchell, Joseph O’Sullivan, Sebastian Thrun",1994/7,,,,,,"Explanation-based neural network learning (EBNN) has recently been introduced as a method for reducing the amount of training data required for reliable generalization, by relying instead on approximate, previously learned knowledge. We present rst experiments applying EBNN to the problem of learning object recognition for a mobile robot. In these experiments, a mobile robot traveling down a hallway corridor learns to recognize distant doors based on color camera images and sonar sensations. The previously learned knowledge corresponds to a neural network that recognizes nearby doors, and a second network that predicts the state of the world after travelling forward in the corridor. Experimental results show that EBNN is able to use this approximate prior knowledge to signi cantly reduce the number of training examples required to learn to recognize distant doors. We also present results of experiments in which networks learned by EBNN (eg,\there is a door 2 meters ahead"") are then used as background knowledge for learning subsequent functions (eg,\there is a door 3 meters ahead"").",8회,"Explanationbased learning for mobile robot perception

Contextual Parameter Generation for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction,"George Stoica, Otilia Stretcu, Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Tom Mitchell, Barnabás Póczos",2020/4/3,,34,03,3000-3008,,"We consider the task of knowledge graph link prediction. Given a question consisting of a source entity and a relation (eg, Shakespeare and BornIn), the objective is to predict the most likely answer entity (eg, England). Recent approaches tackle this problem by learning entity and relation embeddings. However, they often constrain the relationship between these embeddings to be additive (ie, the embeddings are concatenated and then processed by a sequence of linear functions and element-wise non-linearities). We show that this type of interaction significantly limits representational power. For example, such models cannot handle cases where a different projection of the source entity is used for each relation. We propose to use contextual parameter generation to address this limitation. More specifically, we treat relations as the context in which source entities are processed to produce predictions, by using relation embeddings to generate the parameters of a model operating over source entity embeddings. This allows models to represent more complex interactions between entities and relations. We apply our method on two existing link prediction methods, including the current state-of-the-art, resulting in significant performance gains and establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. These gains are achieved while also reducing convergence time by up to 28 times.",7회,"Contextual Parameter Generation for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction

Askworld: Budget-sensitive query evaluation for knowledge-on-demand,"Mehdi Samadi, Partha Talukdar, Manuela Veloso, Tom Mitchell",2015/6/23,,,,,,"Recently, several Web-scale knowledge harvesting systems have been built, each of which is competent at extracting information from certain types of data (eg, unstructured text, structured tables on the web, etc.). In order to determine the response to a new query posed to such systems (eg, is sugar a healthy food?), it is useful to integrate opinions from multiple systems. If a response is desired within a specific time budget (eg, in less than 2 seconds), then maybe only a subset of these resources can be queried. In this paper, we address the problem of knowledge integration for on-demand time-budgeted query answering. We propose a new method, AskWorld, which learns a policy that chooses which queries to send to which resources, by accommodating varying budget constraints that are available only at query (test) time. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate AskWorld’s capability in selecting most informative resources to query within test-time constraints, resulting in improved performance compared to competitive baselines.",7회,"Askworld: Budget-sensitive query evaluation for knowledge-on-demand

The second treats the activity level as unobserved and infers it from the expression of the genes the TF regulates. While both types of methods were successfully applied, each suffers from drawbacks that limit their accuracy. For the first set, the assumption that mRNA levels are correlated with activity is violated for many TFs due to post-transcriptional modifications.

Machine learning meets natural language,Tom Mitchell,1997/10/6,,,,391,,"The majority of the world's online data now exists in the form of text, rather than as numeric or symbolic data. It is therefore natural to seek better methods for automatically interpreting such text data. For example, consider the fact that your computer workstation can now retrieve up to 200,000,000 pages of text from the World Wide Web, but does not currently understand the content of any of these pages.
This talk considers how we might use machine learning methods to improve the ability of computers to interpret and process text data. First, we examine a class of learning algorithms that view each text document as a"" bag of words"", ignoring information about the sequence in which these words occur. Recently these methods have been shown to be surprisingly successful at learning to classify various types of documents. For example, we will describe our NewsWeeder system, which learns the reading interests of various individuals from training examples of news articles they have read and liked (or disliked) in the past. This learned interest profile is then used to recommend interesting new articles to the user.",7회,"Machine learning meets natural language

Toward a learning robot,"Tom M Mitchell, Matthew T Mason, Alan D Christiansen",1989/1/24,,,,,Carnegie-Mellon University. Department of Computer Science,"The problem of robot manipulation-of planning how to successfully grasp, push, and pull arbitrary objects to reconfigure them as desired-is an unsolved problem in robotics. We are presently developing a hand-eye system which is intended to begin with simple knowledge about how to manipulate its world, and to itself acquire increasingly refined knowledge about manipulation in specialized contexts. For example, the robot may begin with knowledge such as"" to move an object somewhere to the right, push from some point on the left"", and may refine the knowledge through experience into more specific, more precise assertions such as"" to move an object which is in contact with a wall to the right in a straight line, push from a point on the left which is 2/3 of the distance from the wall"" The learning method is a type of explanation-based generalization driven by an incomplete theory of the domain-in particular by a theory for qualitative differential analysis. This paper presents an approach to constructing a planning/learning system of this kind, and is primarily organized around a hand-generated example of the type of behavior our system is intended to exhibit.",7회,"Toward a learning robot

We Don't Speak the Same Language: Interpreting Polarization through Machine Translation,"Ashiqur R KhudaBukhsh, Rupak Sarkar, Mark S Kamlet, Tom M Mitchell",2020/10/5,,,,,,"Polarization among US political parties, media and elites is a widely studied topic. Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media. In this paper, we present a new methodology that offers a fresh perspective on interpreting polarization through the lens of machine translation. With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different\emph {languages}, we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6.5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide--what is\emph {black lives matter} to one can be\emph {all lives matter} to the other.",6회,"We Don't Speak the Same Language: Interpreting Polarization through Machine Translation

Jelly Bean World: A testbed for never-ending learning,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Abulhair Saparov, Tom Mitchell",2020/2/15,,,,,,"Machine learning has shown growing success in recent years. However, current machine learning systems are highly specialized, trained for particular problems or domains, and typically on a single narrow dataset. Human learning, on the other hand, is highly general and adaptable. Never-ending learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to bridge this gap, with the goal of encouraging researchers to design machine learning systems that can learn to perform a wider variety of inter-related tasks in more complex environments. To date, there is no environment or testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems. To this end, we propose the Jelly Bean World testbed. The Jelly Bean World allows experimentation over two-dimensional grid worlds which are filled with items and in which agents can navigate. This testbed provides environments that are sufficiently complex and where more generally intelligent algorithms ought to perform better than current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches. It does so by producing non-stationary environments and facilitating experimentation with multi-task, multi-agent, multi-modal, and curriculum learning settings. We hope that this new freely-available software will prompt new research and interest in the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems and more broadly, general intelligence systems.",6회,"Jelly Bean World: A testbed for never-ending learning

Ctps: Contextual temporal profiles for time scoping facts using state change detection,"Derry Tanti Wijaya, Ndapandula Nakashole, Tom Mitchell",2014/10,,,,1930-1936,,"Temporal scope adds a time dimension to facts in Knowledge Bases (KBs). These time scopes specify the time periods when a given fact was valid in real life. Without temporal scope, many facts are underspecified, reducing the usefulness of the data for upper level applications such as Question Answering. Existing methods for temporal scope inference and extraction still suffer from low accuracy. In this paper, we present a new method that leverages temporal profiles augmented with context—Contextual Temporal Profiles (CTPs) of entities. Through change patterns in an entity’s CTP, we model the entity’s state change brought about by real world events that happen to the entity (eg, hired, fired, divorced, etc.). This leads to a new formulation of the temporal scoping problem as a state change detection problem. Our experiments show that this formulation of the problem, and the resulting solution are highly effective for inferring temporal scope of facts.",6회,"Ctps: Contextual temporal profiles for time scoping facts using state change detection

Interactive task and concept learning from natural language instructions and GUI demonstrations,"Toby Jia-Jun Li, Marissa Radensky, Justin Jia, Kirielle Singarajah, Tom M Mitchell, Brad A Myers",2019/8/30,,,,,,"Natural language programming is a promising approach to enable end users to instruct new tasks for intelligent agents. However, our formative study found that end users would often use unclear, ambiguous or vague concepts when naturally instructing tasks in natural language, especially when specifying conditionals. Existing systems have limited support for letting the user teach agents new concepts or explaining unclear concepts. In this paper, we describe a new multi-modal domain-independent approach that combines natural language programming and programming-by-demonstration to allow users to first naturally describe tasks and associated conditions at a high level, and then collaborate with the agent to recursively resolve any ambiguities or vagueness through conversations and demonstrations. Users can also define new procedures and concepts by demonstrating and referring to contents within GUIs of existing mobile apps. We demonstrate this approach in PUMICE, an end-user programmable agent that implements this approach.

The semantics of adjective noun phrases in the human brain,"Alona Fyshe, Gustavo Sudre, Leila Wehbe, Nicole Rafidi, Tom M Mitchell",2019/1/1,,,,089615,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"As a person reads, the brain performs complex operations to create higher order semantic representations from individual words. While these steps are effortless for competent readers, we are only beginning to understand how the brain performs these actions. Here, we explore semantic composition using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of people reading adjective-noun phrases presented one word at a time. We track the neural representation of semantic information over time, through different brain regions. Our results reveal two novel findings: 1) a neural representation of the adjective is present during noun presentation, but this neural representation is different from that observed during adjective presentation 2) the neural representation of adjective semantics observed during adjective reading is reactivated after phrase reading, with remarkable consistency. We also note that while the semantic representation of the adjective during the reading of the adjective is very distributed, the later representations are concentrated largely to temporal and frontal areas previously associated with composition. Taken together, these results paint a picture of information flow in the brain as phrases are read and understood.",5회,"The semantics of adjective noun phrases in the human brain

Merging knowledge bases in different languages,"Jerónimo Hernández-González, Estevam R Hruschka Jr, Tom Mitchell",2017/8,,,,21-29,,"Recently, different systems which learn to populate and extend a knowledge base (KB) from the web in different languages have been presented. Although a large set of concepts should be learnt independently from the language used to read, there are facts which are expected to be more easily gathered in local language (eg, culture or geography). A system that merges KBs learnt in different languages will benefit from the complementary information as long as common beliefs are identified, as well as from redundancy present in web pages written in different languages. In this paper, we deal with the problem of identifying equivalent beliefs (or concepts) across language specific KBs, assuming that they share the same ontology of categories and relations. In a case study with two KBs independently learnt from different inputs, namely web pages written in English and web pages written in Portuguese respectively, we report on the results of two methodologies: an approach based on personalized PageRank and an inference technique to find out common relevant paths through the KBs. The proposed inference technique efficiently identifies relevant paths, outperforming the baseline (a dictionary-based classifier) in the vast majority of tested categories.",5회,"Merging knowledge bases in different languages

A probabilistic generative grammar for semantic parsing,"Abulhair Saparov, Tom M Mitchell",2016/6/20,,,,,,"We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of natural language sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parser that jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representations of a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate a sentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior, such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semantic statement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence. A joint semantic-syntactic parser is derived that returns the -best semantic and syntactic parses for a given sentence. The semantic prior is flexible, and can be used to incorporate background knowledge during parsing, in ways unlike previous semantic parsing approaches. For example, semantic statements corresponding to beliefs in a knowledge base can be given higher prior probability, type-correct statements can be given somewhat lower probability, and beliefs outside the knowledge base can be given lower probability. The construction of our grammar invokes a novel application of hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs), which in turn, requires a novel and efficient inference approach. We present experimental results showing, for a simple grammar, that our parser outperforms a state-of-the-art CCG semantic parser and scales to knowledge bases with millions of beliefs.",5회,"A probabilistic generative grammar for semantic parsing

Assuming facts are expressed more than once,"Justin Betteridge, Alan Ritter, Tom Mitchell",2014/5/3,,,,,,"Distant supervision (DS) is a method for training sentence-level information extraction models using only an unlabeled corpus and a knowledge base (KB). Fundamental to many DS approaches is the assumption that KB facts are expressed at least once (EALO) in the text corpus. Often, however, KB facts are actually expressed in the corpus many times, in which cases EALO-based systems underuse the available training data. To address this problem, we introduce the “expressed at least α percent”(EALA) assumption, which asserts that expressions of KB facts account for up to α% of the corresponding mentions. We show that for the same level of precision as the EALO approach, the EALA approach achieves up to 66% higher recall on category recognition and 53% higher recall on relation recognition.",5회,"Assuming facts are expressed more than once

An agent for learning new natural language commands,"Amos Azaria, Shashank Srivastava, Jayant Krishnamurthy, Igor Labutov, Tom M Mitchell",2020/4,,34,1,1-27,Springer US,"Teaching via natural language is an intuitive way for end users to add functionality to a virtual assistant, enabling them to personalize their assistant with new commands without requiring the intervention of the system developer, who cannot possibly anticipate all of an end user’s needs. In this paper we introduce our Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA), the first virtual assistant, for an email domain, that is capable of learning how to perform new commands taught by end users in natural language. LIA grounds the semantics of each command in terms of primitive executable procedures. When a user provides LIA with a command that it does not understand, it prompts the user to explain the command through a sequence of natural language steps. From this input, LIA learns the meaning of the new command and how to generalize the command to novel situations. For example, having been taught how to “forward an …",4회,"An agent for learning new natural language commands

Discourse in multimedia: A case study in extracting geometry knowledge from textbooks,"Mrinmaya Sachan, Avinava Dubey, Eduard H Hovy, Tom M Mitchell, Dan Roth, Eric P Xing",2020/1,,45,4,627-665,MIT Press,"To ensure readability, text is often written and presented with due formatting. These text formatting devices help the writer to effectively convey the narrative. At the same time, these help the readers pick up the structure of the discourse and comprehend the conveyed information. There have been a number of linguistic theories on discourse structure of text. However, these theories only consider unformatted text. Multimedia text contains rich formatting features that can be leveraged for various NLP tasks. In this article, we study some of these discourse features in multimedia text and what communicative function they fulfill in the context. As a case study, we use these features to harvest structured subject knowledge of geometry from textbooks. We conclude that the discourse and text layout features provide information that is complementary to lexical semantic information. Finally, we show that the harvested …",4회,"Discourse in multimedia: A case study in extracting geometry knowledge from textbooks

A Semi-Supervised Learning,"Niddal Imam, Biju Issac, Seibu Mary Jacob",2019,,,,,by: World Scientific,"Twitter has changed the way people get information by allowing them to express their opinion and comments on the daily tweets. Unfortunately, due to the high popularity of Twitter, it has become very attractive to spammers. Unlike other types of spam, Twitter spam has become a serious issue in the last few years. The large number of users and the high amount of information being shared on Twitter play an important role in accelerating the spread of spam. In order to protect the users, Twitter and the research community have been developing different spam detection systems by applying different machine-learning techniques. However, a recent study showed that the current machine learning-based detection systems are not able to detect spam accurately because spam tweet characteristics vary over time. This issue is called'Twitter Spam Drift'. In this paper, a semisupervised learning approach (SSLA) has been proposed to tackle this. The new approach uses the unlabeled data to learn the structure of the domain. Different experiments were performed on English and Arabic datasets to test and evaluate the proposed approach and the results show that the proposed SSLA can reduce the effect of Twitter Spam Drift and outperform the existing techniques.",4회,"A Semi-Supervised Learning

From selfish auctioning to incentivized marketing,"Lantao Liu, Dylan A Shell, Nathan Michael",2014/12,,37,4,417-430,Springer US,"Auction and market-based mechanisms are among the most popular methods for distributed task allocation in multi-robot systems. Most of these mechanisms were designed in a heuristic way and analysis of the quality of the resulting assignment solution is rare. This paper presents a new market-based multi-robot task allocation algorithm that produces optimal assignments. Rather than adopting a buyer’s “selfish” bidding perspective as in previous auction/market-based approaches, the proposed method approaches auctioning from a merchant’s point of view, producing a pricing policy that responds to cliques of customers and their preferences. The algorithm uses price escalation to clear a market of all its items, producing a state of equilibrium that satisfies both the merchant and customers. This effectively assigns all robots to their tasks. The proposed method can be used as a general assignment algorithm as it …",4회,"From selfish auctioning to incentivized marketing

From journal articles to computational models: a new automated tool,Tom M Mitchell,2011/8,,8,8,627-628,Nature Publishing Group,"Most neuroscience research today is datastarved: it seeks to model a very complicated system (the brain) using only the data from a single experimental study. As we attempt to build increasingly accurate models of larger and larger brain systems, the only plausible way forward is to build models that integrate data and distilled results from many previously published studies, along with the new experimental data from our own work. One approach will be to build shared repositories of curated experimental data, and such efforts have already begun. Today, however, the largest already available shared repository of experimental results is in online journals.

By introducing a formyl group as a model for the adrenergic receptor it is found that the noradrenaline side chain hydroxyl function is oriented away from the phenyl ring. In the case of the ring fluorinated compounds a fluorine-oxygen electrostatic repulsion leads to a preferred phenyl conformation. It is suggested that the α-receptor conformation corresponds to a value of the ring torsion angle, τ, of about 130° whereas 310° is required for the torsion angle when bound to the β-receptor.",4회,"A theoretical study of the influence of noradrenaline ring fluorination on its adrenergic activity

Many representation techniques also require significant manual data annotation efforts. This paper presents Screen2Vec, a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is inspired by the word embedding method Word2Vec, but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and incorporates screen-and app-specific metadata.

The way in which neurons represent thought is one of the major open questions of neuroscience. Advances is neuroimaging, including Magnetoencephalography (MEG), have allowed us to capture data on a finer time scale and record the neural signature of thoughts evolving in the human brain. In this report we explore several methods of analyzing the signal recorded by the MEG machine, and use that analyzed signal to predict the word a person is reading. The utility of different signal transformations is assessed by measuring their ability to encode the semantic properties of words. We hope the discoveries outlined in this report will help to explain how groups of neurons can encode concepts, and in turn will lead to a better understanding of the human brain.",3회,"Decoding word semantics from magnetoencephalography time series transformations

CAP II extends CAP in providing facilities that support the autonomous negotiation of meeting dates via email. That means, once the user has entered the wish for a meeting, a proposal is generated and sent to all desired attendees. If they possess a CAP II system, all agents negotiate until they succeed in nding a commonly accepted date. This feature, asynchronous and (to some extent) user-independent negotiation, makes the apprentice an agent.
An important feature of the CAP II system is the possibility to include non-CAP users too. That means, everybody who does not possess a CAP II agent can be included in negotiations as long as she or he is reachable by email.

Experimental data for the central hypotensive activity in normotensive rats following intravenous administration were recalculated with corrections for the amounts of basic and protonated forms and for the concentration of drug reaching the brain. The most important electronic parameter in the regressions reported is the LUMO energy which appears in the regressions considered with a positive coefficient. It is suggested that a charge-transfer interaction occurs involving the basic forms of the drug molecules, which leads to a reduction in hypotensive activity. An increase in hypotensive activity appears to follow an ionic interaction of the protonated drug species.",3회,"A molecular-orbital study of the structure-activity relationships of some imidazolidines related to clonidine

Conversational neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning,"Forough Arabshahi, Jennifer Lee, Mikayla Gawarecki, Kathryn Mazaitis, Amos Azaria, Tom Mitchell",2020/6/17,,,,,,"One aspect of human commonsense reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about daily experiences, activities and social interactions with others. We propose a new commonsense reasoning benchmark where the task is to uncover commonsense presumptions implied by imprecisely stated natural language commands in the form of if-then-because statements. For example, in the command"" If it snows at night then wake me up early because I don't want to be late for work"" the speaker relies on commonsense reasoning of the listener to infer the implicit presumption that it must snow enough to cause traffic slowdowns. Such if-then-because commands are particularly important when users instruct conversational agents. We release a benchmark data set for this task, collected from humans and annotated with commonsense presumptions. We develop a neuro-symbolic theorem prover that extracts multi-hop reasoning chains and apply it to this problem. We further develop an interactive conversational framework that evokes commonsense knowledge from humans for completing reasoning chains.",2회,"Conversational neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning

Mining and organizing a resource of state-changing verbs,"Derry Tanti Wijaya, Ndapandula Nakashole, Tom M Mitchell",2014,,4,,,,"Most knowledge bases (KBs) that emerged in recent years are static. They contain facts about the world yet are seldom updated as the world changes: attributes or possessions of entities in the KB change over time; what (actions) the entities can do or what can be done to them change over time. Current methods for extracting facts in the KBs do not yet detect such state changes although these changes have implications for the correctness of the KB. We propose a method for learning change-of-states in entities that are brought about by event-expressing verbs acting on the entities. These change of states in entities can be viewed as KB updates of facts pertaining to these entities. We envision a resource of state changing verbs, that contains pre-and post-conditions of each verb on its arguments: the entry condition of entities that allow an event expressed by the verb to take place and the condition of entities that will be true after the event occurs. When a state changing verb acts on an entity or when the entity’s state change is detected in text, we can use the resource to update KB facts about the entity.",2회,"Mining and organizing a resource of state-changing verbs

Previous work has concentrated on small sets of words in a handful of concrete classes, and so has been ill-suited to testing competing theories of semantic organisation. Here we examine a wider range of word types on the concrete-abstract continuum, and consider how well experimental results fit with taxonomic, embodied, associational and situational accounts of meaning. Each semantic theory is instantiated with a corpusderived distributional model of semantics, and we quantify how each representation can account for the similarity structure of experimental fMRI activations.

Artificial intelligence and human brain imaging,Tom M Mitchell,2003/6/11,,,,7-7,"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","For many years AI researchers have sought to understand the nature of intelligence primarily by creating artificially intelligent computer systems. Studies of human intelligence have had less influence on AI, partly because of the great difficulty in directly observing human brain activity. In recent years, new methods for observing brain activity have become available, notably functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) which allows us to safely, non-invasively capture images of activity across the brain once per second, at millimeter spatial resolution. The advent of fMRI has already produced dramatic new insights into human brain activity, and how it varies with cognitive task. This breakthrough in instrumentation (and others as well) shifts the balance of utility between building artificial intelligent systems and studying natural intelligence. As a result, we should expect a growing synergy in the future between …",2회,"Artificial intelligence and human brain imaging

In response to the difficulties of encoding ever-increasing volumes of knowledge in modern Al systems, many researchers have recently turned their attention to machine learning as a means to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Part 1 of this paper presents a taxonomic analysis of machine learning organized primarily by learning strategies and secondarily by knowledge representation and application areas. A historical survey outlining the development of various approaches to machine learning is presented from early neural networks to present knowledge intensive techniques. Part II to be published in a subsequent issue will outline major present research directions, and suggest viable areas for future investigation.

Besides the well-known knowledge acquisition and automated learning methods we propose an approach called dialog-based learning (DBL), that allows the user to teach the system directly while performing the task. It acquires knowledge through a dialog in which the user both illustrates the procedure using a grounded example, and provides instructions about how to perform the task in the general case. We focus discussion on CAP II (a program that schedules meetings by negotiation via email), and on RAP (a program that makes room reservation via email).",2회,"O ce Automation Systems that are\Programmed"" by their Users

Fringe News Networks: Dynamics of US News Viewership following the 2020 Presidential Election,"Ashiqur R KhudaBukhsh, Rupak Sarkar, Mark S Kamlet, Tom M Mitchell",2021/1/22,,,,,,"The growing political polarization of the American electorate over the last several decades has been widely studied and documented. During the administration of President Donald Trump, charges of ""fake news"" made social and news media not only the means but, to an unprecedented extent, the topic of political communication. Using data from before the November 3rd, 2020 US Presidential election, recent work has demonstrated the viability of using YouTube's social media ecosystem to obtain insights into the extent of US political polarization as well as the relationship between this polarization and the nature of the content and commentary provided by different US news networks. With that work as background, this paper looks at the sharp transformation of the relationship between news consumers and here-to-fore ""fringe"" news media channels in the 64 days between the US presidential election and the violence that took place at US Capitol on January 6th. This paper makes two distinct types of contributions. The first is to introduce a novel methodology to analyze large social media data to study the dynamics of social political news networks and their viewers. The second is to provide insights into what actually happened regarding US political social media channels and their viewerships during this volatile 64 day period.",1회,"Fringe News Networks: Dynamics of US News Viewership following the 2020 Presidential Election

Discovering bilingual lexicons in polyglot word embeddings,"Ashiqur R KhudaBukhsh, Shriphani Palakodety, Tom M Mitchell",2020/8/31,,,,,,"Bilingual lexicons and phrase tables are critical resources for modern Machine Translation systems. Although recent results show that without any seed lexicon or parallel data, highly accurate bilingual lexicons can be learned using unsupervised methods, such methods rely on the existence of large, clean monolingual corpora. In this work, we utilize a single Skip-gram model trained on a multilingual corpus yielding polyglot word embeddings, and present a novel finding that a surprisingly simple constrained nearest-neighbor sampling technique in this embedding space can retrieve bilingual lexicons, even in harsh social media data sets predominantly written in English and Romanized Hindi and often exhibiting code switching. Our method does not require monolingual corpora, seed lexicons, or any other such resources. Additionally, across three European language pairs, we observe that polyglot word embeddings indeed learn a rich semantic representation of words and substantial bilingual lexicons can be retrieved using our constrained nearest neighbor sampling. We investigate potential reasons and downstream applications in settings spanning both clean texts and noisy social media data sets, and in both resource-rich and under-resourced language pairs.",1회,"Discovering bilingual lexicons in polyglot word embeddings

Learning from Imperfect Annotations,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Maruan Al-Shedivat, Eric Xing, Tom Mitchell",2020/4/7,,,,,,"Many machine learning systems today are trained on large amounts of human-annotated data. Data annotation tasks that require a high level of competency make data acquisition expensive, while the resulting labels are often subjective, inconsistent, and may contain a variety of human biases. To improve the data quality, practitioners often need to collect multiple annotations per example and aggregate them before training models. Such a multi-stage approach results in redundant annotations and may often produce imperfect"" ground truth"" that may limit the potential of training accurate machine learning models. We propose a new end-to-end framework that enables us to:(i) merge the aggregation step with model training, thus allowing deep learning systems to learn to predict ground truth estimates directly from the available data, and (ii) model difficulties of examples and learn representations of the annotators that allow us to estimate and take into account their competencies. Our approach is general and has many applications, including training more accurate models on crowdsourced data, ensemble learning, as well as classifier accuracy estimation from unlabeled data. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our method on 5 crowdsourcing datasets of varied difficulty and show accuracy gains of up to 25% over the current state-of-the-art approaches for aggregating annotations, as well as significant reductions in the required annotation redundancy.",1회,"Learning from Imperfect Annotations

Look-up and adapt: A one-shot semantic parser,"Zhichu Lu, Forough Arabshahi, Igor Labutov, Tom Mitchell",2019/10/27,,,,,,"Computing devices have recently become capable of interacting with their end users via natural language. However, they can only operate within a limited"" supported"" domain of discourse and fail drastically when faced with an out-of-domain utterance, mainly due to the limitations of their semantic parser. In this paper, we propose a semantic parser that generalizes to out-of-domain examples by learning a general strategy for parsing an unseen utterance through adapting the logical forms of seen utterances, instead of learning to generate a logical form from scratch. Our parser maintains a memory consisting of a representative subset of the seen utterances paired with their logical forms. Given an unseen utterance, our parser works by looking up a similar utterance from the memory and adapting its logical form until it fits the unseen utterance. Moreover, we present a data generation strategy for constructing utterance-logical form pairs from different domains. Our results show an improvement of up to 68.8% on one-shot parsing under two different evaluation settings compared to the baselines.",1회,"Look-up and adapt: A one-shot semantic parser

In this paper, we will first offer a theoretical discussion on the design of the policy L, and provide empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of the derived algorithm. We will then briefly touch on the issue of designing the policy H at the end of this paper, and demonstrate a simple pruning strategy and how it can contribute positively to the performance of the algorithm.",1회,"Combining neighborhood-based heuristics: A framework and pilot study on baselines

Discourse in multimedia: A case study in information extraction,"Mrinmaya Sachan, Kumar Avinava Dubey, Eduard H Hovy, Tom M Mitchell, Dan Roth, Eric P Xing",2018/11/13,,,,,,"To ensure readability, text is often written and presented with due formatting. These text formatting devices help the writer to effectively convey the narrative. At the same time, these help the readers pick up the structure of the discourse and comprehend the conveyed information. There have been a number of linguistic theories on discourse structure of text. However, these theories only consider unformatted text. Multimedia text contains rich formatting features which can be leveraged for various NLP tasks. In this paper, we study some of these discourse features in multimedia text and what communicative function they fulfil in the context. We examine how these multimedia discourse features can be used to improve an information extraction system. We show that the discourse and text layout features provide information that is complementary to lexical semantic information commonly used for information extraction. As a case study, we use these features to harvest structured subject knowledge of geometry from textbooks. We show that the harvested structured knowledge can be used to improve an existing solver for geometry problems, making it more accurate as well as more explainable.",1회,"Discourse in multimedia: A case study in information extraction

Machine reading with background knowledge,"Ndapandula Nakashole, Tom M Mitchell",2016/12/16,,,,,,"Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural language text are important for many artificial intelligence applications including mobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understanding language often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquired view of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text alone to infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machine reading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate language understanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first method addresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses background knowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from both labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art results on two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extracts relationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound noun analysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms a baseline that does not make use of background knowledge.",1회,"Machine reading with background knowledge

During experiments on monkeys, 2 we analyzed the single neurons’ encoding of corresponding hand orientations and movement directions. The results indicated that a common pathway for both parameters might exist in the same regions of the motor cortex. After that work, we further explored the properties of neural activity during a reach-to-grasp task at the neural network level.

Memory Approaches To Reinforcement Learning In Non-Markovian Domains,Long-Ji Lin Tom M Mitchell,1992/5,,,,,"Tech. Rep. CMU-CS-92-138. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Google Scholar Google Scholar Digital Library Digital Library","Reinforcement learning is a type of unsupervised learning for sequential decision making. Q-learning is probably the best-understood reinforcement learning algorithm. In Q-learning, the agent learns a mapping from states and actions to their utilities. An important assumption of Q-learning is the Markovian environment assumption, meaning that any information needed to determine the optimal actions is reected in the agent's state representation. Consider an agent whose state representation is based solely on its immediate perceptual sensations. When its sensors are not able to make essential distinctions among world states, the Markov assumption is violated, causing a problemcalled perceptual aliasing. For example, when facing a closed box, an agent based on its current visual sensation cannot act optimallyif the optimal action depends on the contents of the box.

This report begins with an introduction, summary of achievements, and lists of personnel and publications. It also includes several papers resulting from this research. This research is primarily sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Portions of this research are also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The research program includes a broad agenda in the development of an autonomous mobile robot. In the year covered by this report, we addressed four major topics: Configuration: We configured the Ambler (acronym for Autonomous MoBiLe Exploration Robot) as a walking robot to overcome the shortcomings exhibited by existing wheeled and walking robot mechanisms. The fundamental advantage of the Ambler configuration—which has implications for efficiency, mechanism modeling, and control simplicity—is that actuators for body support are independent of those for propulsion; a subset of the planar joints propel the body, and the vertical actuators support and level the body over terrain. Perception: To characterize local scene geometry, we developed several different techniques for constructing elevation maps from range images provided by a scanning laser range finder. Further, we developed techniques to (1) evaluate elevation map regions as footfall locations,(2) match elevation maps, and (3) extract topographic terrain features from elevation maps (peak, pit, ridge, valley, etc).",1회,"1989 year end report: autonomous planetary rover at Carnegie Mellon

As a next step we seek a general theory capable of predicting the neural activity associated with arbitrary words not yet included in experiments. We present here the first such predictive theory, in the form of a computational model that is trained using a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus, and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.

Semi-supervised Data Clustering with Coupled Non-negative Matrix Factorization: Sub-category Discovery of Noun Phrases in NELL’s Knowledge Base,"Chunlei Liu, Tom Mitchell",,,,,1-19,,"The standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular method to obtain low-rank approximation of a non-negative matrix, which is also powerful for clustering and classification in machine learning. In NMF each data sample is represented by a vector of features of the same dimension. In practice, we often have good side information for a subset of data samples. These side information might be binary vectors that indicate human provided class labels, or generic vectors in a different feature space. In this paper we propose the coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) method to automatically incorporate the side information of a subset of data. In CNMF, the matrix for data samples with or without side information in the original feature space and the matrix for data samples with side information in the new feature space are coupled together and iteratively optimized. Because of different qualities of the side information, a trade-off parameter is introduced to determine the importance of the side information, and we give a cross validation method to choose its value. The time complexity of the CNMF method could be several times bigger than the original NMF method, but still in the same order. As an example of implementing the CNMF method, we look into the knowledge base of the CMU Never-Ending Language Learning (NELL) project and find sub-categories of noun phrases.",1회,"Semi-supervised Data Clustering with Coupled Non-negative Matrix Factorization: Sub-category Discovery of Noun Phrases in NELL’s Knowledge Base

MVPA does not reveal neural representations of hierarchical linguistic structure in MEG,"Sophie L Arana, Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, Tom Mitchell, Peter Hagoort",2021/1/1,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"During comprehension, the meaning extracted from serial language input can be described by hierarchical phrase structure. Whether our brains explicitly encode hierarchical structure during processing is, however, debated. In this study we recorded Magnetoencephalography (MEG) during reading of structurally ambiguous sentences to probe neural activity for representations of underlying phrase structure. 10 human subjects were presented with simple sentences, each containing a prepositional phrase that was ambiguous with respect to its attachment site. Disambiguation was possible based on semantic information. We applied multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to the MEG data using linear classifiers as well as representational similarity analysis to probe various effects of phrase structure building on the neural signal. Using MVPA techniques we successfully decoded both syntactic (part-of-speech) as well as semantic information from the brain signal. Importantly, however, we did not find any patterns in the neural signal that differentiate between different hierarchical structures. Nor did we find neural traces of syntactic or semantic reactivation following disambiguating sentence material. These null findings suggest that subjects may not have processed the sentences with respect to their underlying phrase structure. We discuss methodological limits of our analysis as well as cognitive theories of ""shallow processing"", i.e. in how far rich semantic information can prevent thorough syntactic analysis during processing.",,"MVPA does not reveal neural representations of hierarchical linguistic structure in MEG

Modeling Task Effects on Meaning Representation in the Brain via Zero-Shot MEG Prediction,"Mariya Toneva, Otilia Stretcu, Barnabas Poczos, Leila Wehbe, Tom M Mitchell",2020,,33,,,,"How meaning is represented in the brain is still one of the big open questions in neuroscience. Does a word (eg, bird) always have the same representation, or does the task under which the word is processed alter its representation (answering< code> can you eat it?"" versus can it fly?"")? The brain activity of subjects who read the same word while performing different semantic tasks has been shown to differ across tasks. However, it is still not understood how the task itself contributes to this difference. In the current work, we study Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recordings of participants tasked with answering questions about concrete nouns. We investigate the effect of the task (ie the question being asked) on the processing of the concrete noun by predicting the millisecond-resolution MEG recordings as a function of both the semantics of the noun and the task. Using this approach, we test several hypotheses about the task-stimulus interactions by comparing the zero-shot predictions made by these hypotheses for novel tasks and nouns not seen during training. We find that incorporating the task semantics significantly improves the prediction of MEG recordings, across participants. The improvement occurs 475-550ms after the participants first see the word, which corresponds to what is considered to be the ending time of semantic processing for a word. These results suggest that only the end of semantic processing of a word is task-dependent, and pose a challenge for future research to formulate new hypotheses for earlier task effects as a function of the task and stimuli.",,"Modeling Task Effects on Meaning Representation in the Brain via Zero-Shot MEG Prediction

Spatio-temporal Characteristics of Noun and Verb Processing during Sentence Comprehension in the Brain,"Sharmistha Jat, Erika JC Laing, Partha Talukdar, Tom Mitchell",2020/1/1,,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,"The human brain is very effective at integrating new words one by one into the composed representation of a sentence as it is read left-to-right. This raises the important question of what happens to the neural representations of words present earlier in the sentence? For example, do the strength of word representations encountered earlier on in the sentence remain constant or do they evolve as additional words are processed? Representation of words by neural activity in the brain has been the subject of several previous studies. We perform the experiment with a naturalistic task in which the subjects read simple active and passive sentences. Naturalistic studies have tended to explore words in isolation or in a very limited context (e.g., adjective-noun phrases). Representation of previously encountered words during incremental sentence reading, and how such representation evolve as more parts of a sentence are read, is a fundamental but unexplored problem -- we take a first step in this direction. In particular, we examine the spatio-temporal characteristics of neural activity encoding nouns and verbs encountered in a sentence as it is read word-by-word. We use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to passively observe neural activity, providing 1 ms temporal resolution. Our experiments reveal that nouns and verbs read early in the sentence have a varying influence on neural activity while reading subsequent words, decreasing and increasing at particular word positions in active and passively voiced sentences, with particularly important contributions to activity in frontal and temporal cortical regions.

Learning to Ask for Conversational Machine Learning,"Shashank Srivastava, Igor Labutov, Tom Mitchell",2019/11,,,,4155-4165,,"Natural language has recently been explored as a new medium of supervision for training machine learning models. Here, we explore learning classification tasks using language in a conversational setting–where the automated learner does not simply receive language input from a teacher, but can proactively engage the teacher by asking questions. We present a reinforcement learning framework, where the learner’s actions correspond to question types and the reward for asking a question is based on how the teacher’s response changes performance of the resulting machine learning model on the learning task. In this framework, learning good question-asking strategies corresponds to asking sequences of questions that maximize the cumulative (discounted) reward, and hence quickly lead to effective classifiers. Empirical analysis across three domains shows that learned question-asking strategies expedite classifier training by asking appropriate questions at different points in the learning process. The approach allows learning classifiers from a blend of strategies, including learning from observations, explanations and clarifications.",,"Learning to Ask for Conversational Machine Learning

In this paper, we describe a new multi-modal domain-independent approach that combines natural language programming and programming-by-demonstration to allow users to first naturally describe tasks and associated conditions at a high level, and then collaborate with the agent to recursively resolve any ambiguities or vagueness through conversations and demonstrations. Users can also define new procedures and concepts by demonstrating and referring to contents within …",,"Interactive Task and Concept Learning from Natural Language Instructions and GUI Demonstrations

A Multi-modal Approach to Concept Learning in Task Oriented Conversational Agents,"Toby Jia-Jun Li, Marissa Radensky, Tom Mitchell, Brad Myers",2019/5,,,,,,"This chapter introduces an end user development (EUD) approach for handling common types of failures encountered by goal-oriented conversational agents. We start with identifying three common sources of failures in human-agent conversations: unknown concepts, out-of-domain tasks and wrong fulfillment means or level of generalization in task execution. To handle these failures, it is useful to enable the end user to program the agent and to “teach” the agent what to do as a fallback strategy. Showing examples for this approach, we walk through our two integrated systems: Sugiliteand Lia. Sugiliteuses the programming by demonstration (PBD) technique, allowing the user to program the agent by demonstrating new tasks or new means for completing a task using the GUIs of third-party smartphone apps, while Lia learns new tasks from verbal instructions, enabling the user to teach the agent through breaking down the procedure verbally. Lia also enables the user to verbally define unknown concepts used in the commands and adds those concepts into the agent’s ontology. Both Sugilite and Lia can generalize what they have learned from the user across related entities and perform a task with new parameters in a different context.",,"A Multi-modal Approach to Concept Learning in Task Oriented Conversational Agents

Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Otilia Stretcu, Graham Neubig, Barnabas Poczos, Tom M Mitchell",2019/3,,,,arXiv: 1903.09848,,"Current state-of-the-art NMT systems use large neural networks that are not only slow to train, but also often require many heuristics and optimization tricks, such as specialized learning rate schedules and large batch sizes. This is undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time, reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and results in overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way of deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training …",,"Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation

This parameter generator accepts source and target language embeddings as input, and generates the parameters for the encoder and the decoder, respectively. The rest of the model remains unchanged and is shared across all languages.

and Inductively,"Tom M Mitchell, Sebastian B Thrun",2014/3/5,,,,85,Psychology Press,"8c Newell, 1986). This chapter considers the question of what constitutes an appropriate general-purpose learning mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that might explain and reproduce the rich variety of learning capabilities of humans, ranging from learning perceptual-motor skills such as how to ride a bicycle, to learning highly cognitive tasks such as how to play chess. Research on learning in ﬁelds such as cognitive science, artiﬁcial intelli-gence, neurobiology, and statistics has led to the identiﬁcation of two distinct classes of learning methods: inductive and analytic. Inductive methods, such as neural network backpropagation, learn general laws by ﬁnding statistical correlations and regularities among a large set of training examples. In contrast, analytical methods, such as explanation-based learning, acquire general laws from many fewer training examples. They rely instead on prior knowledge to analyze individual training examples in detail, then use this analysis to distinguish relevant example features from the irrelevant. The question considered in this chapter is how to best combine inductive and analytical learning in an architecture that seeks to cover the range of learning exhibited by intelligent systems such as humans. We present a speciﬁc learning mechanism, explanation-based neural network learning (EBNN), that blends these two types of learning, and present experimental results demonstrating its ability to learn control strategies for a mobile",,"and Inductively

More specifically, given the stimulus, what are the interactions between (groups of) neurons (also known as functional connectivity) and how can we automatically infer those interactions, given measurements of the brain activity? Furthermore, how does this connectivity differ across different human subjects? In this work we present a simple, novel good-enough brain model, or GEBM in short, and a novel algorithm SPARSE-SYSID, which are able to effectively model the dynamics of the neuron interactions and infer the functional connectivity. Moreover, GEBM is able to simulate basic psychological phenomena such as habituation and priming (whose definition we provide in the main text). We evaluate GEBM by using both synthetic and real brain data. Using the real data, GEBM produces brain activity patterns that are strikingly similar to the real ones, and the inferred functional connectivity is able to provide neuroscientific insights towards a better understanding of the way that neurons interact with each other, as well as detect regularities and outliers in multi-subject brain activity measurements.",,"Good-Enough Brain Model: Challenges, Algorithms and Discoveries in Multi-Subject Experiments

We consider the question of whether office automation systems can be developed that allow users who are not skilled programmers to easily “program"", or customize, these tools themselves. In other words, can we deploy very general, non-customized programs that can be extended and adapted during usage? Besides the well-known knowledge acquisition andautomated learningmethods we propose an approach called dialog-based learning (DBL), that allows the usertoteach the systemdirectly while performing the task. It acquires knowledge through a dialog in which the user both illustrates the procedure using a grounded example, and provides instructions about how to perform the task in the general case. We focus discussion on CAP II (a program that schedules meetings by negotiation via email), and on RAP (a program that makes room reservation via email).",,"Office Automation Systems that are “Programmed” by

In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses.

We propose SCOUP-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that SCOUP-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend SCOUP-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply SCOUP-SMT to BRAINQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. SCOUPSMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy.

"Learning with Sparsity: Structures, Optimization and Applications",Tom Mitchell,2011/11/15,,,,,,"The development of modern technology has enabled collecting data of unprecedented size and complexity. Examples include web text data, microarray & proteomics, and data from scientific domains (eg, meteorology). To learn from these high dimensional and complex data, traditional machine learning techniques often suffer from the curse of dimensionality and unaffordable computational cost.
Recently developed sparse learning techniques provide us a suite of tools for understanding and exploring high dimensional data from many areas in science and engineering. By exploring sparsity, we can always learn a parsimonious and compact model which is more interpretable and computationally tractable at application time. When it is known that the underlying model is indeed sparse, sparse learning methods can provide us a more consistent model and much improved prediction performance. However, the existing methods are still insufficient for modeling complex or dynamic structures of the data and nonlinear relationships between inputs and response, such as those evidenced in pathways of genomic data, gene regulatory network, and synonyms in text data.",,"Learning with Sparsity: Structures, Optimization and Applications

Fortunately, various types of extra information exist in real-world problems, characterizing the properties of the model space, the feature space and the label space, respectively. With the goal of supervision reduction, this thesis studies the representation, discovery and incorporation of extra information in learning.
Extra information about the model space can be encoded as compression operations and used to regularize models in terms of compressibility. This leads to learning compressible models. Examples of model compressibility include local smoothness, compacted energy in frequency domains, and parameter correlation. When multiple related tasks are learned together, such a compact representation can be automatically inferred as a matrix-variate normal distribution with sparse inverse covariances on the parameter matrix, which simultaneously captures both task relations and feature structures.",,"Supervision Reduction by Encoding Extra Information about Models, Features and Labels

Using fMRI Brain Activation to Identify Cognitive States Associated,"SV Shinkareva, RA Mason, VL Malave, W Wang, TM Mitchell",2008,,,,,,"It has been a lasting challenge to establish the correspondence between a simple cognitive state (such as the thought of a hammer) and the underlying brain activity. Moreover, it is unknown whether the correspondence is the same across individuals. A recent approach to studying brain function uses machine learning techniques to identify the neural pattern of brain activity underlying various thought processes. Previous studies using a machine learning approach have been able to identify the cognitive states associated with viewing an object category, such as houses [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The central characteristic of this approach (compared to a conventional statistical parametric mapping-like approach) is its identification of a multivariate pattern of voxels and their characteristic activation levels that collectively identify the neural response to a stimulus. These machine learning methods have the potential to be particularly useful in uncovering how semantic information about objects is represented in the cerebral cortex because they can determine the topographic distribution of the activation and distinguish the content of the information in various parts of the cortex. In the study reported below, the neural patterns associated with individual objects as well as with object categories [9] were identified using a machine learning algorithm applied to activation distributed throughout the cortex. This study also investigated the degree to which objects and categories are similarly represented neurally across different people. We analyzed the brain activity of participants who were viewing a line drawing of an object from the categories of tools or dwellings …",,"Using fMRI Brain Activation to Identify Cognitive States Associated

Inferring Users’ Projects from their Workstation,"Tom M Mitchell, Sophie H Wang, Yifen Huang, Adam Cheyer",2005/11,,,,,,"One key to providing intelligent assistance to workstation users is to construct machine-understandable descriptions of the user’s ongoing projects, or activities,(eg, their committee memberships, writing projects, conference organization activities), and indices describing which emails, meetings, and colleagues relate to which activity. This paper presents a program, ActivityExtractor, which examines the user’s workstation contents to infer such activity descriptions. In earlier work [Huang, et al., 2004] we described an algorithm which infers activities by clustering the user’s emails based on their word distributions. Here we extend this approach in several ways:(1) by incorporating a social network analysis of email senders and recipients,(2) by considering workstation contents beyond email, including contents accessible via Google Desktop Search, and (3) by allowing simple user input in the form of a list of activity/project names. We describe the ActivityExtractor algorithms and report on experiments applying these to several users’ workstations.",,"Inferring Users’ Projects from their Workstation

Data-driven modelling of learner’s cognitive style in educational hypermedia,"S Fragos, T Mitchell, S Chen, LK Stergioulas",2004/7/24,,31,,,WIT Press,"In this paper we propose a framework for modelling the user behaviour in hypermedia systems. This involves the design of time-based features and the selection of the most useful ones that can give the best classification and prediction. The process of variable selection involves a sensitivity analysis via neural network bootstrapping, which aims at maximising the model’s classification performance and generalisation ability. The goal of this study is to model and assess the learners’ holist/analytic cognitive styles based on the navigational trail recorded while they navigate through learning hypermedia content.

Along the new axes, the sample variances are extremes (maxima and minima), and uncorrelated. The name comes from the principal axes of an ellipsoid (eg the ellipsoid of inertia), which are just the coordinate axes in question.
By their definition, the principal axes will include those along which the point sample has little or no spread (minima of variance). Hence, an analysis in terms of principal components can show (linear) interdependence in data. A point sample of L dimensions for whose L coordinates M linear relations hold, will show only (L-M) axes along which the spread is non-zero.

Following their inspiration, I will take this opportunity to lay out some of my own views on teaching machine learning. When I wrote the textbook Machine Learning a few years ago, it reflected a philosophy about teaching machine learning that grew out of my fifteen years of experience teaching it to different groups of students and professionals. It still does. Simply put, this philosophy is that the best way to understand machine learning is to do two things at once. First, to study in detail a range of representative learning algorithms (eg, neural network learning, Bayesian learning, decision tree learning, reinforcement learning, etc.) that arise from a variety of disciplines (eg, probability and statistics, engineering and control theory …",,"Author's response to reviews of Machine Learning

CONALD Report on the Workshop on Learning from Text and the Web,"Jaime G Carbonell, Mark Craven, Steve Fienberg, Tom Mitchell, Yiming Yang",1998,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University,"An increasing fraction of the world's information and data is now represented in textual form. For example, the World Wide Web, online news feeds, and other Internet sources contain a tremendous volume of textual information. The goal of the CONALD workshop on Learning from Text and the Web was to explore computer methods for automatically extracting, clustering and classifying information from text and hypertext sources.
The workshop included ten oral paper presentations, an organized discussion by a panel of distinguished researchers, and a handful of other contributed papers. The workshop provided a good survey of the state of the art in machine learning methods applied to text processing tasks. The presented work involved a wide array of learning approaches, including nite-state-machine induction HD, MMK], neural networks that can accept advice from users SER], relational learning methods Moo, SC], statistical clustering algorithms GS, Hof, LV, YPC], boosting methods ADW], algorithms for learning with hierarchical classes Hof, MG], and active learning methods LT, NM]. A principal limitation of many of these approaches is that they do not directly re ect attempts to develop formal models of the text phenomenon of interest. The research presented at the workshop also spanned a broad range of application tasks, including: information extraction HF, HD, LS, Moo, MMK], information nding SER], information integration from Web sources MMK], automatic citation indexing BLG, KP], event detection in text streams YPC], document routing ADW] and classi cation GWI, Moo], organization and presentation of documents in information …",,"CONALD Report on the Workshop on Learning from Text and the Web

MySearch-A User Interest Oriented Front-end to Web Search Engines,"Rosie Jones, Tom Mitchell, Jaime Carbonell, Jill Lehman, Nancy Green",1997/5/14,,,,,,"The advantages inherent in the vast quantities of information available and easily accessible on the world-wide web are o set by the di culties most users have in nding the information most appropriate to their needs in a short period of time. General search engines which index using the bag-of-word paradigm return more documents than can reasonably be inspected. Web indices aid in navigation of the information available on the web, but have much lower coverage. Searching is one of the most common activities on the web, making up one in eight of some users' web accesses, but is not always successful. Two types of problems prevent a search from returning the most appropriate documents. The rst is ambiguity in the search terms theselves. Word-sense disambiguation is a traditional NLP problem, causing di culties for translation systems, understanding systems, and information retrieval systems. Common statistical techniques involve using the surrounding textual context to disambiguate the word. Information Retrieval evaluations frequently rely on queries of su cient length that word-context will aid in disambiguation of certain terms. However, lay-person search queries from a sample of Pittsburgh users are on average 2.4 words long-too few to use any large or small textual context window for disambiguation. Knowledge of other aspects of the context can aid in disambiguation. This project looks at modeling the user's long-term interests, based on a history of web accesses to text and HTML documents, to aid in disambiguation of words. The second problem is inappropriateness of documents returned, while still relevant to the intended …",,"MySearch-A User Interest Oriented Front-end to Web Search Engines

In software systems that find information for users, there is a role for learning the interests of individual users, and for learning how to locate different types of information. We describe two applications of machine learning to information finding, then suggest several directions for future research.
One task where learning can be useful is netnews reading. Although there are over 8000 electronic newsgroups, nobody reads more than a few. A newsreader that learned its user's interests could therefore help the user by locating appropriate articles within the thousands of unread newsgroups.

Constraining Neural Networks to Fit Target Slopes,"Ryusuke Masuoka, Sebastian Thrun, Tom M Mitchell",1993/6/11,,,,,,"A variety of methods have recently been proposed for constraining neural networks to t various constraints while being trained. One such approach is to constrain the function approximated by the network to t desired slopes, or derivatives. Such slopes may be provided by the designer, as in Simard's character recognizer network which was constrained so that the slope of the output with respect to translations, rotations, etc. of the input should be zero. Alternatively, target slopes may be generated automatically by program as in Explanation Based Neural Network (EBNN) learning. This paper explores the role of slope information in constraining neural network learning. In particular, we present a mathematical framework and algorithms for using slopes to constrain learning. This approach is then compared with standard backpropagation, in terms of the quality of learned generalizations, as well as time and space complexity.

Genetic algorithm is a natural candidate for learning in games. In this paper we study the use of genetic algorithms in game-playinglearning programs, emphasising on learning a static evaluation function. Instead of blindly tting the problem to genetic algorithm, we modied genetic algorithms to t the problem, achieving better results. We began by deciding to invest our eorts in learning an evaluation function rather than learn a complete strategy from scratch. We further determined that the precise learning task is nding an order relation rather than absoluteclassications. We then concluded that it is benecial to learn an evaluation function by its derivatives, and designed a derivative crossover operator that combines good building blocks. A heuristic continuity assumption has proven advantageous in the genetic search. In a series of experiments performed with the new framework, the program acquired an …",,"14] L. Rendell.

Can We Build Learning Robots? Peut-on construire des robots qui apprennent?,Tom M Mitchell,1990,,,,259,Morgan Kaufmann Pub,"Yes. At least simple ones... One approach to overcoming the brittleness and inflexibility of current robot systems is to develop approaches that allow them to learn from their experience. This talk discusses the general problem of robot learning, and focuses on three types of learning that are currently exhibited by prototype robot systems in our laboratory. The first is learning of strategies for approaching and recognizing simple objects (eg, cups, boxes) using sonar sensors aboard a mobile robot. The robot is trained by showing it a new type of object, and it inductively learns to approach, sense, and discriminate the object from others it has observed. The second type of learning automatically improves robot reactivity for routine actions by compiling the results of slow, deliberate planning into stimulusresponse rules. These learned rules produce the same decisions as the original planning process, but reduce the reaction time of the robot from minutes to subsecond. The third type of learning improves the robot's ability to correctly pre-dict the effects of its actions on the world, thus improving the correctness of its control decisions. This third project uses a robot arm manipulating objects, with feedback provided by a vision system.",,"Can We Build Learning Robots? Peut-on construire des robots qui apprennent?

This report begins with an introduction, summary of achievements, and lists of personnel and publications. It also includes several papers resulting from this research. This research is primarily sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Portions of this research are also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The research program includes a broad agenda in the development of an autonomous mobile robot. In the year covered by this report, we addressed four major topics: Configuration: We configured the Ambler (acronym for Autonomous MoBiLe Exploration Robot) as a walking robot to overcome the shortcomings exhibited by existing wheeled and walking robot mechanisms. The fundamental advantage of the Ambler configuration—which has implications for efficiency, mechanism modeling, and control simplicity—is that actuators for body support are independent of those for propulsion; a subset of the planar joints propel the body, and the vertical actuators support and level the body over terrain. Perception: To characterize local scene geometry, we developed several different techniques for constructing elevation maps from range images provided by a scanning laser range finder. Further, we developed techniques to (1) evaluate elevation map regions as footfall locations,(2) match elevation maps, and (3) extract topographic terrain features from elevation maps (peak, pit, ridge, valley, etc).",,"1988 year end report: autonomous planetary rover at Carnegie Mellon

Turbo-SMT: Accelerating Coupled Sparse Matrix-Tensor Factorizations by 200x-Supplementary Material,"Evangelos E Papalexakis, Tom M Mitchell, Nicholas D Sidiropoulos, Christos Faloutsos, Partha Pratim Talukdar, Brian Murphy",,,,,,,"This supplementary document serves as an appendix to the main manuscript. In Section 1, we provide an overview of one of our baselines, the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, and we provide a modification thereof that yields significant speedup. In Section 2, we show how we can make Turbo-SMT, when using ALS, robust to missing values (in [2], the authors propose a version of their algorithm that deals with missing values). In Section 3, we compare Turbo-SMT to approaches that might consider compressing the tensor using a Tucker3 model. Finally, in Section 4, we showcase the generality of the CMTF framework, and consequently of Turbo-SMT, with an application to a time evolving social network, with side information. In Table 1, we provide an overview of the symbols used.",,"Turbo-SMT: Accelerating Coupled Sparse Matrix-Tensor Factorizations by 200x-Supplementary Material

INSIGHTS,"Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell",,,,,,,"SCIENCE sciencemag. org generally have been important for overall improvements in income and living standards, and the first wave of pre-ML information technology (IT) systems in particular has created trillions of dollars of economic value,“The case that technological advances have contributed to wage inequality is strong”[see (1), a report from a committee we recently cochaired for the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine]. Although there are many forces contributing to inequality, such as increased globalization, the potential for large and rapid changes due to ML, in many cases within a decade, suggests that the economic effects may be highly disruptive, creating both winners and losers. This will require considerable attention among policy-makers, business leaders, technologists, and researchers. As machines automate some of the tasks that are SML in a particular job or process, the remaining tasks that are non-SML may become more valuable. In other cases, machines will augment human capabilities and make possible entirely new products, services, and processes. Therefore, the net effect on the demand for labor, even within jobs that are partially automated, can be either negative or positive. Although broader economic effects can be complex, labor demand is more likely to fall for tasks that are close substitutes for capabilities of ML, whereas it is more likely to increase for tasks that are complements for these systems. Each time an ML system crosses the threshold where it becomes more cost-effective than humans on a task, profit-maximizing entrepreneurs and managers will increasingly seek to …",,"INSIGHTS

Knowledge Base Construction in the Machine-learning Era,"TM Mitchell, WW Cohen, ER Hruschka Jr, PP Talukdar, J Betteridge, A Carlson, BD Mishra, M Gardner, B Kisiel, J Krishnamurthy",,,,,,,"This installment of Research for Practice features a curated selection from Alex Ratner and Chris Ré, who provide an overview of recent developments in Knowledge Base Construction (KBC). While knowledge bases have a long history dating to the expert systems of the 1970s, recent advances in machine learning have led to a knowledge base renaissance, with knowledge bases now powering major product functionality including Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Wolfram Alpha. Ratner and Ré’s selections highlight key considerations in the modern KBC process, from interfaces that extract knowledge from domain experts to algorithms and representations that transfer knowledge across tasks.
More information is accessible today than at any other time in human history. From a software perspective, however, the vast majority of this data is unusable, as it is locked away in unstructured formats such as text, PDFs, web pages, images, and other hard-to-parse formats. The goal of KBC (knowledge base construction) is to extract structured information automatically from this “dark data,” so that it can be used in downstream applications for search, question-answering, link prediction, visualization, modeling and much more. Today, KBs (knowledge bases) are the central components of systems that help fight human trafficking, 18 accelerate biomedical discovery, 9 and, increasingly, power web-search and question-answering technologies. 4",,"Knowledge Base Construction in the Machine-learning Era

Neural Cognitive Architectures for Never-Ending Learning,"Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Tom Mitchell, Eric Horvitz, Rich Caruana, Graham Neubig",,,,,,,"Allen Newell argued that the human mind functions as a single system and proposed the notion of a unified theory of cognition (UTC). Most existing work on UTCs has focused on symbolic approaches, such as the Soar architecture (Laird, 2012) and the ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004) system. However, such approaches limit a system’s ability to perceive information of arbitrary modalities, require a significant amount of human input, and are restrictive in terms of the learning mechanisms they support (supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc.). For this reason, researchers in machine learning have recently shifted their focus towards subsymbolic processing with methods such as deep learning. Deep learning systems have become a standard for solving prediction problems in multiple application areas including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. However, many real-world problems require integrating multiple, distinct modalities of information (eg, image, audio, language, etc.) in ways that machine learning models cannot currently handle well. Moreover, most deep learning approaches are not able to utilize information learned from solving one problem to directly help in solving another. They are also not capable of never-ending learning, failing on problems that are dynamic, ever-changing, and not fixed a priori, which is true of problems in the real world due to the dynamicity of nature. In this thesis, we aim to bridge the gap between UTCs, deep learning, and never-ending learning. To that end, we propose a neural cognitive architecture (NCA) that is inspired by human cognition and that …",,"Neural Cognitive Architectures for Never-Ending Learning

This is particularly difficult for general-purpose task-oriented agents, as the unknown concepts and the tasks can be outside of the agent’s existing domain of knowledge. In this work, we propose a new multi-modal mixed-initiative approach towards this problem. Our agent Pumice guides the user to recursively explain unknown concepts through conversations, and to ground these concepts by demonstrating on the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of existing third-party mobile apps. Pumice also supports the generalization of learned concepts to other different contexts and task domains.",,"Toby Jia-Jun Li tobyli@ cs. cmu. edu Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA

Never-Ending Learning for Open-Domain Semantic Parsing,"Abulhair Saparov, Tom Mitchell, William Cohen, Frank Pfenning, Vijay Saraswat",,,,,,,"In this thesis, we explore the hypothesis that techniques from never-ending learning and curriculum learning can be applied to the problem of training an open-domain semantic parser. To train such a parser in a traditional supervised setting would require an insurmountable amount of labeled data. Instead, we propose a method that uses a semantic parser to learn definitions of new previously-unrecognized words, and to induce and populate a theory (knowledge base) that explains (via logical entailment) the observed sentences. As definitions of new words are parsed, they can be used to produce self-supervised training examples for the semantic parser, increasing its vocabulary of recognized words. Our parser outputs partial logical forms for sentences that contain unrecognized tokens. Therefore, if a sentence defines a previously unseen word, the unrecognized token can be linked to a new or existing concept in the theory, and the resulting logical form along with the sentence become a newly labeled training example. We apply Bayesian statistical machine learning, enabling every component in our proposed method to be interpretable, composeable with other models, and guided by prior information. For example, we can impose a prior that favors simpler and more consistent theories over more complex ones. This also enables our semantic parser to be driven and guided by the background knowledge stored in the theory, thus closing the loop and enabling the reading competence of the semantic parser to increase over time, as it reads more and more definitional sentences. We also propose a method to perform active data collection: to …",,"Never-Ending Learning for Open-Domain Semantic Parsing

"1 Bayesian Networks [25 pts, Field Cady]","Eric Xing, Tom Mitchell, Aarti Singh",,,,,,,"One useful aspect of Bayesian networks is that they can make use of expert knowledge about a domain. Let’s take a (highly) simplified view of land-based ecosystems, and try to characterize all ecosystems in the world. Two of the most important aspects of an ecosystem are temperature (T) and precipition (P); an area can be either hot or cold, and either wet, moist or dry. The foundation of an ecosystem is its vegetation (V), and it is either sparse or dense, and either trees or shrubs/grasses (so 4 possibilities). More water and higher temperatures both make trees more likely and vegetation more dense. The presence grazing animals (G, boolean for whether or not there are grazing animals), like bison, depends on there being a lot of grass, but they don’t really need rain or moderate temperatures. Frogs (F, boolean for whether there are frogs), on the other hand, need lots of water and prefer to live near trees. Construct a Bayesian network to describe the relationship between these random variables.",,"1 Bayesian Networks [25 pts, Field Cady]

AAAI–96,"Tom Mitchell, What Have We",,,,,,,"The National Conference on Artificial Intelligence provides a unique opportunity for timely interaction and communication among researchers and practitioners from all areas of AI. This year the program committee continued the policy established two years ago to broaden participation at the conference. Once again, the community has responded enthusiastically, submitting over 640 papers. Each paper was reviewed by three reviewers under the supervision of one of twenty-eight senior members of the AI community who supervised broad areas of research. The evaluation criteria recognized a wide range of scientific contributions. Of the papers originally submitted, 5 were withdrawn by their authors, 441 were rejected, and 197 were accepted. The reviewers and senior members of the program committee did a superb job, in their diligence, fairness, and enthusiasm.
Ramesh Patil deserves special credit for developing and maintaining a world-wide web site, which we used for reviewer self-selection of papers in the blind review process. In addition, Ben Kuipers and Bonnie Webber, cochairs for next year's conference, provided invaluable assistance at the initial sorting of papers; we have communicated with them throughout to ensure continuity and improvement to the reviewing process. Barbara Hayes-Roth, the conference chair, provided a tone of gracious stability to establish our agenda and guide where needed throughout.

1 Explanation Based Learning for Mobile Robot Perception,"Joseph O'Sullivan, Tom M Mitchell, Sebastian Thrun",,,,,,,"Although machine learning techniques have been applied with remarkable success to several problems of computer perception and vision, most of these problems have been fairly simple in nature. The di culty with scaling up to more complex tasks is that inductive learning methods require a very large number of training examples in order to generalize correctly from complex sensor data.
This chapter proposes an approach to overcoming this di culty, by relying on previously learned information to augment the available training data. In particular, we consider the task faced by a mobile robot learning to recognize new objects within an already-familiar environment. Because the robot has previously operated within this environment (here the corridors of a particular building), it has already had the opportunity to learn certain regularities that can be useful in subsequent learning tasks. Given a new task, such as learning to recognize the distance to the next door in the corridor, knowledge of these regularities enables the system to learn the new task more accurately from a limited quantity of new training data. We describe the Explanation-Based Neural Network (EBNN) algorithm for utilizing previously learned knowledge, and examine its performance for the mobile robot perception task of door recognition in a familiar corridor based on color vision and sonar sensor data. Experimental results indicate that EBNN is able to generalize more accurately than purely inductive methods such as Backpropagation, even when its prior knowledge is only approximately correct.",,"1 Explanation Based Learning for Mobile Robot Perception

An Autonomous Rover for Planetary Exploration,"Tom Mitchell, Reid Simmons, William Whittaker",,,,,,,"] ohn Bares, Martial Hebert, Takeo Kanade, Eric Krotkov, Tom Mitchell, Reid Simmons, and William Whittaker or centuries people have been fas-F cinated by Earth‘s planetary neighbors. There has been much speculation, in science and science fiction, about what lies on and under their surfaces. Despite considerable study, our knowledge remains very limited. Orbiting vehicles cannot examine internal features, and stationary vehicles, like the three Soviet and two US landers on Mars, miss what is over the horizon, atop mountains, and in ravines.
Active exploration of other planets could answer many questions about the nature and origins of our solar system. Sending astronauts or remotely controlled vehicles is a possibility, but a manned expedition is highly unlikely in the near future, and conventional teleoperation is impractical because of the long signal times (for example, up to 45 minutes for a round trip to Mars …",,"An Autonomous Rover for Planetary Exploration

Analyzing Pattern-based Distant Supervision for Semantic Category and Relation Recognition,"Justin Betteridge, Burr Settles, Tom Mitchell",,,,,,,"Automatically mining a variety of semantic information from a stream of text depends upon the ability to label noun phrases in context with the semantic category of the entity to which they refer. Although modern named entity recognition (NER) systems are robust, they are still limited to the small set of semantic categories for which labeled training data exist (eg, person, organization, location). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art information extraction (IE) techniques that require minimal human effort to significantly broaden the set of semantic categories that can be reliably annotated in a stream of text. We describe a process for inducing semantic category recognizers, ie, text stream annotators, that requires only a dozen or so seed examples of the target category as initial human input. A key contribution is our full evaluation of this approach for 74 semantic categories (almost 8000 sentences) with a test set of …",,"Analyzing Pattern-based Distant Supervision for Semantic Category and Relation Recognition

What functional brain imaging reveals about the semantic representa-tion of object knowledge,"Kai-min Kevin Chang, Tom Mitchell, Marcel Adam Just",,,,,,,"We propose a generative classifier which models the hidden factors that underpin the neural representation of objects with a multivariate multiple linear regression model. Our results indicate that object features derived from a feature norming study or word cooccurrences in web corpus can capture some of these hidden factors and explain a significant portion of the systematic variance in the neural activity observed in an object-contemplation task. Furthermore, the resulting regression model is useful for decoding mental states, can generalize across people, and allows us to extrapolate the neural activity for unseen objects, which cannot be done with a discriminative classifier.",,"What functional brain imaging reveals about the semantic representa-tion of object knowledge

rsonal Learning Apprentice,"Lisa Dent, Jesus Boticariol, John McDermott, Tom Mitchell, David Zabowski",,,,,,,"Personal knowledge-based assistants have the potential to assist with many daily tasks. For example, a university faculty member might utilize various software assistants to manage courses, to organize the graduate admissions committee, and to manage a meeting calendar. Consider the example of a knowledge-based agent which provides an interface for editing a meeting calendar and advice such as when and where to schedule specific meetings, how long the meeting should last, whether to move an existing meeting to make room for the new meeting, whether to send electronic mail reminders to the participants, etc. The agent might also represent the faculty member in his or her absence by responding automatically to electronic mail requesting certain types of meetings. In order to be effective, such an agent would need considerable regarding the scheduling preferences and of the individual faculty member (eg, that meetings with graduate students are typically located in the faculty member’s office, that meetings with undergraduates during office hours are typically allocated 30 minutes), as well as knowledge of various individuals within the environment (eg, that Jon is an undergraduate majoring in computer science, that I7aj is the Dean of computer science).
While such a knowledge-based assistant would be helpful, developing and maintaining such a system is difficult because (1) specifying the appropriate program action at design time is possible only for a very unambitious definition of “appropriate”,(2) even if appropriate specifications could be obtained for one person, they must be redefined for each new user, and (3) even if one …",,"rsonal Learning Apprentice

Hyper-rectangular Space Partitioning trees are multivariate tree classi ers designed for continuous predictors. They allow easy interpretation of the solutions, generating rules expressed as simple conditions on the predictive variables, and they possess the property of monotone transformation invariance. Besides their outstanding theoretical properties, the few experiments conducted in this work indicate that it would be worth considering further approaches for fully practical methods. The simple algorithms developed in this paper allowed to highlight some interesting features such as increased stability of the tree solution including in the presence of noise, shorter trees and good relative results especially on moderate or smaller sample sizes. Numerous"" natural"" developments can be considered relatively to the usual features of tree methods (alternative variable selection criteria, split points selection criteria, pruning techniques,...) and relatively to the particular aspects related to their necessary approximation.",,"Friedman, J. and Fisher, N.(1999).

Quantitative modeling of the neural representation of nouns and phrases,Tom Mitchell,,,,,,,"Recent advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offer a significant new approach to studying semantic representations in humans by making it possible to directly observe brain activity while people comprehend words and sentences. In the proposed work, we used fMRI to study the cortical systems that underpin semantic representation while people comprehended linguistic concepts like concrete objects, adjective-noun phrases, or noun-noun concept combinations. The thesis of this research is that the distributed pattern of neural activity encodes the meanings of linguistic concepts and intermediate semantic representation can be used to model how brain composes the meaning of words or phrases in terms of more primitive semantic features. In an object-contemplation task, participants were presented with line drawings and/or text labels of objects and were instructed to think of the same properties of the stimulus object consistently during multiple presentations of each item. By learning 1) the correspondence between features in semantic models and neural activity, and 2) the semantic composition model that governs how words are combined to form phrases, this work enables a predictive theory that is capable of extrapolating the model of the neural activity to previously unseen words and phrases.",,"Quantitative modeling of the neural representation of nouns and phrases

Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM KAMAL NIGAM knigam@ cs. cmu. edu ANDREW KACHITES MCCALLUM mccallum@ justresearch. com,"SEBASTIAN THRUN, TOM MITCHELL",,,1,,34,,"This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available. We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor …",,"Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM KAMAL NIGAM knigam@ cs. cmu. edu ANDREW KACHITES MCCALLUM mccallum@ justresearch. com

Subsumption deletion and an action set GA bring XCS close to the point of evolving populations consisting of accurate, maximally general, near-minimal covers of task environments, along with a residue of other classifiers of very low fitness. The ability to detect and represent environmental equivalences—to generalize accurately—is indispensable to creatures both natural and artificial. XCS appears to do this with tractable time and space complexity, and without needing, or being constrained by, pre-existing structure—classifiers simply evolve to suit the problem and its regularities. Many topics—for instance real-valued input vectors, incorporation of internal state, and application to robotics and other real-world domains—remain for future research.",,"Booker, LB (1989).

Cannabis sativa L. (C. sativa) is an annual dioecious plant, which shares its origins with the inception of the first agricultural human societies in Asia. Over the course of time different parts of the plant have been utilized for therapeutic and recreational purposes, for instance, extraction of healing oils from seed, or the use of inflorescences for their psychoactive effects. The key psychoactive constituent in C. sativa is called Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC). The endocannabinoid system seems to be phylogenetically ancient, as it was present in the most primitive vertebrates with a neuronal network. N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are the main endocannabinoids ligands present in the animal kingdom, and the main endocannabinoid receptors are cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor and cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptor.

Performance of LAMP mainly relies on crafting of six primers (including 2 loop primers) ultimately accelerating the reaction. LAMP amplifies DNA in the process pyrophosphates are formed causing turbidity that facilitates visualisation in a more effective way than PCR. The Bst and Bsm polymerase are the required enzymes for LAMP that does not possess 5'-3'exonuclease activity. Results can be visualized by adding DNA binding dye, SYBR green. LAMP is more stable than PCR and real-time PCR. Non-involvement of template DNA preparation and ability to generate 10 (9) copies of DNA are added benefits that make it more effective than …",190회,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP): a new diagnostic tool lights the world of diagnosis of animal and human pathogens: a review.

Understanding the viral traits that overcome this bottleneck could have important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design and other prevention strategies. Most T/F viruses use CCR5 to infect target cells and some encode envelope glycoproteins (Envs) that contain fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shorter V1/V2 variable loops than Envs from chronic viruses. Moreover, it has been reported that the gp120 subunits of certain transmitted Envs bind to the gut-homing integrin α4β7, possibly enhancing virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. Here we sought to determine whether subtype C T/F viruses, which are responsible for the majority of new HIV-1 infections worldwide, share biological properties that increase their transmission fitness, including preferential α4β7 engagement. Using single genome amplification, we generated panels of both T/F (n = 20) and chronic (n = 20) Env constructs as well as full-length T/F (n = 6) and chronic (n = 4) infectious molecular clones (IMCs). We found that T/F and chronic control Envs were indistinguishable in the efficiency with which they used CD4 and CCR5. Both groups of Envs also exhibited the same CD4+ T cell subset tropism and showed similar sensitivity to neutralization by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies. Finally, saturating concentrations of anti-α4β7 antibodies failed to inhibit infection and replication of T/F as well as chronic control viruses, although the growth of the tissue culture-adapted strain …",169회,"Transmitted/founder and chronic subtype C HIV-1 use CD4 and CCR5 receptors with equal efficiency and are not inhibited by blocking the integrin α4β7

Expression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase β (PI3Kβ) isoform, but not its activity, is essential for early embryonic development. Nonetheless, the specific function of PI3Kβ in the cell remains elusive. Double-strand breaks (DSB) are among the most deleterious lesions for genomic integrity; their repair is required for development. We show that PI3Kβ is necessary for DSB sensing, as PI3Kβ regulates binding of the Nbs1 sensor protein to damaged DNA. Indeed, Nbs1 did not bind to DSB in PI3Kβ-deficient cells, which showed a general defect in subsequent ATM and ATR activation, resulting in genomic instability. Inhibition of PI3Kβ also retarded the DNA repair but the defect was less marked than that induced by PI3Kβ deletion, supporting a kinase …",152회,"Nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase β controls double-strand break DNA repair

Human ATR associates with the nuclear envelope during S phase and prophase, and both osmotic stress and mechanical stretching relocalize ATR to nuclear membranes throughout the cell cycle. The ATR-mediated mechanical response occurs within the range of physiological forces, is reversible, and is independent of DNA damage signaling.

Improved dielectric properties were observed in the prepared system. An anomaly in the dielectric constant (ɛ) was observed in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic transition temperature.

Proteomic investigations of lysine acetylation identify diverse substrates of mitochondrial deacetylase sirt3,"Eri Maria Sol, Sebastian A Wagner, Brian T Weinert, Amit Kumar, Hyun-Seok Kim, Chu-Xia Deng, Chunaram Choudhary",2012/12/7,,7,12,e50545,Public Library of Science,"Lysine acetylation is a posttranslational modification that is dynamically regulated by the activity of acetyltransferases and deacetylases. The human and mouse genomes encode 18 different lysine deacetylases (KDACs) which are key regulators of many cellular processes. Identifying substrates of KDACs and pinpointing the regulated acetylation sites on target proteins may provide important information about the molecular basis of their functions. Here we apply quantitative proteomics to identify endogenous substrates of the mitochondrial deacetylase Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) by comparing site-specific acetylation in wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts to Sirt3 knockout cells. We confirm Sirt3-regulated acetylation of several mitochondrial proteins in human cells by comparing acetylation in U2OS cells overexpressing Sirt3 to U2OS cells in which Sirt3 expression was reduced by shRNA. Our data demonstrate that ablation of Sirt3 significantly increases acetylation at dozens of sites on mitochondrial proteins. Substrates of Sirt3 are implicated in various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These results imply broader regulatory roles of Sirt3 in the mitochondria by modulating acetylation on diverse substrates. The experimental strategy described here is generic and can be applied to identify endogenous substrates of other lysine deacetylases.",132회,"Proteomic investigations of lysine acetylation identify diverse substrates of mitochondrial deacetylase sirt3

The search is performed in channels in which the vector boson decays into leptonic final states (Z→ ν ν, W→ ℓ ν, and Z→ ℓ ℓ, with ℓ= e, μ), while the Higgs boson decays to collimated b quark pairs detected as a single massive jet. The discriminating power of a jet mass requirement and ab jet tagging algorithm are exploited to suppress the standard model backgrounds. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the background expectation.

Successful formation of ZnO-activated carbon (ZnO-AC) and ZnO-brick grain particle (ZnO-BGP) nanocomposites was ascertained by various spectral techniques. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that ZnO particles were highly dispersed in activated carbon/brick grain particles. The size of ZnO-AC and ZnO-BGP was found to be 70 and 80 nm, respectively. Both ZnO-AC and ZnO-BGP exhibited excellent adsorption and photocatalytic activity for malachite green (MG) and congo red dye (CR) degradation.

A hollow fiber membrane photo‐bioreactor for CO2 sequestration from combustion gas coupled with wastewater treatment: a process engineering approach,"Amit Kumar, Xin Yuan, Ashish K Sahu, Jo Dewulf, Sarina J Ergas, Herman Van Langenhove",2010/3,,85,3,387-394,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","BACKGROUND: In the presence of light, micro‐algae convert CO2 and nutrients to biomass that can be used as a biofuel. In closed photo‐bioreactors, however, light and CO2 availability often limit algae production and can be difficult to control using traditional diffuser systems. In this research, a hollow fiber membrane photo‐bioreactor (HFMPB) was investigated to: (1) increase the interfacial contact area available for gas transfer, (2) treat high nutrient strength (412 mg NO3−‐N L−1) wastewater, and (3) produce algal biomass that can be used as a biofuel.
RESULTS: A bench scale HFMPB was inoculated with Spirulina platensis and operated with a 2‐15% CO2 supply. A mass transfer model was developed and found to be a good tool to estimate CO2 mass transfer coefficients at varying liquid velocities. Overall mass transfer coefficients were 1.8 × 10−6, 2.8 × 10−6, 5.6 × 10−6m s−1 at Reynolds numbers of 38 …",127회,"A hollow fiber membrane photo‐bioreactor for CO2 sequestration from combustion gas coupled with wastewater treatment: a process engineering approach

We show that CPNs can act as multifunctional nanoprobes that induce dual photodynamic and photothermal therapeutic effects without a need for organic photosensitizers, coupled with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and allow for imaging and analyzing cells.

Iron plaque (IP) formation is frequent in aquatic and wetland plant species and is responsible for the sequestration of various metal(loids). The presence of IP may act as a buffer or barrier and may thus enhance or reduce the uptake of potentially phytotoxic metals and metalloids by plants. If IP acts as a barrier, then low IP producing macrophytes/aquatic plants may be better accumulators of toxic metals and may find use in constructed wetlands for remediation of pollutants, while high IP forming edible plant species could be safer for human consumption. Conversely, if IP acts as a buffer for mineral nutrients and toxic elements then those cultivars may be rich in nutrients, but may also cause toxicity.

Conventional diagnostic tests viz.

Particularly, nickel etch control and metal feature edge definition remain problems to be solved if the process is to be employed in submicron feature production. Nickel patterns produced in the process and used as masks without the gold overlayer were successful as masks in the reactive ion etching (RIE) process.

Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are the type of HIV-1 antibodies that are most likely protective, they are not induced with current vaccine candidates. In contrast, antibodies that do not neutralize primary HIV-1 strains in the TZM-bl infection assay are readily induced by current vaccine candidates and have also been implicated as secondary correlates of decreased HIV-1 risk in the RV144 vaccine efficacy trial. Here, we have studied the capacity of anti-Env monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against either the immunodominant region of gp41 (7B2 IgG1), the first constant region of gp120 (A32 IgG1), or the third variable loop (V3) of gp120 (CH22 IgG1) to modulate in vivo rectal mucosal transmission of a high-dose simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-BaL) in rhesus macaques. 7B2 IgG1 or A32 IgG1, each containing mutations to enhance Fc function, was administered passively to rhesus macaques but afforded no protection against productive clinical infection while the positive control antibody CH22 IgG1 prevented infection in 4 of 6 animals. Enumeration of transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses revealed that passive infusion of each of the three antibodies significantly reduced the number of T/F genomes. Thus, some antibodies that bind HIV-1 Env but fail to neutralize virus in traditional neutralization assays may limit the number of T/F viruses involved in transmission without leading to enhancement of viral infection. For one of these mAbs, gp41 mAb 7B2, we provide the first co-crystal …",120회,"Human non-neutralizing HIV-1 envelope monoclonal antibodies limit the number of founder viruses during SHIV mucosal infection in rhesus macaques

The trimetallic catalysts were considerably more professional than bimetallic one. The trimetallic and bimetallic nanoparticles are of enormous attention than that of monometallic in both technological and scientific view as in these nanoparticles the catalytic properties can be tailored better than that of in the single monometallic catalyst. The trimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized by different methods such as microwave, selective catalytic reduction, micro-emulsion, co-precipitation and hydrothermal etc. The surfaces area of trimetallic nanoparticles is comparatively unstable and thus gets simply precipitated away from their solution and ultimately resulted in their reduced catalytic activity.

Rice is major crop in these regions and can potentially pose serious health risks due to its known As accumulation potential. Sulfur (S) is an essential macronutrient and a vital element to combat As toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of S with regards to As toxicity in rice under different S regimes. To achieve this aim, plants were stressed with AsIII and AsV under three different S conditions (low sulfur (0.5 mM), normal sulfur (3.5 mM) and high sulfur (5.0 mM)). High S treatment resulted in increased root As accumulation, likely due to As complexation through enhanced synthesis of thiolic ligands, such as non-protein thiols and phytochelatins, which restricted As translocation to the shoots. Enzymes of S assimilatory pathways and downstream thiolic metabolites were up-regulated with increased …",119회,"Sulfur mediated reduction of arsenic toxicity involves efficient thiol metabolism and the antioxidant defense system in rice

The use of membranes combines selective separation of compounds from a waste gas stream followed by biological removal. Gas transport phenomena and different types of membranes used in biological waste gas treatment are discussed. So far, membrane-based biological waste gas treatment has only been tested on laboratory scale. If the long-term stability of these reactors can be demonstrated, membrane bioreactor technology can be useful in the treatment of gas streams containing poorly water-soluble pollutants and highly chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are difficult to treat with conventional methods for biological waste gas treatment.",118회,"Membrane-based biological waste gas treatment

Accurate calculation of the electromagnetic force field requires complex numerical calculations of three-dimensional current density and magnetic flux fields. Several simplifying assumptions have been suggested to avoid the complex calculations.

Although the T cell receptor (TCR) is a protein Tyr kinase–associated receptor, p110γ deletion affects TCR-induced T cell stimulation. We examined whether the TCR activates p110γ, as well as the consequences of interfering with p110γ expression or function for T cell activation.

The plants survived in fly-ash (100%) though their growth was less in comparison to the treatments. Fly-ash + press-mud (1:1, w/w) proved to be the best combination as growth (total biomass, leaf number, photosynthetic area, total chlorophyll and protein) was significantly high in this treatment followed by cowdung manure and garden soil. Leaves and roots accumulated significant amount of Cu, Zn, Ni and and Fe. However, the concentration of all the metals was more in roots than leaves except Ni.

The one atomic Ti02 layers had the anatase Ti02 (101) structure. The Pt/one-atomic-layer Ti02 retained the anatase structure, whereas the anatase structure was transformed to rutileTi02 (110) plane in the Pd/one-atomic-layer Ti02. The Pt/A-Ti-2 and Pd/A-Ti-2 showed no SMSI phenomenon probably because of the presence of Ti-O-Si bonding. For these catalysts the 773 K reduced catalysts show much higher activities than the 473 K reduced catalysts for ethene hydrogenation.

Low power operation of ferroelectric liquid crystal system dispersed with zinc oxide nanoparticles,"T Joshi, A Kumar, J Prakash, AM Biradar",2010/6/21,,96,25,253109,American Institute of Physics,We present the results based on electro-optical properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) doped ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC). It is observed that ZnO-NPs-FLC system has low operating voltage and improved optical contrast. The lowering in operating voltage and improvement in optical contrast has been attributed to larger dipole moment of ZnO-NPs that enhances the anchoring of FLC molecules around ZnO-NPs. The effect of ZnO-NPs on the material parameters of FLC has also been observed. These studies will certainly provide a tool to understand the interaction of ZnO-NPs with FLC molecules that can be utilized to fabricate low threshold electro-optic devices.,107회,"Low power operation of ferroelectric liquid crystal system dispersed with zinc oxide nanoparticles

Nodal signaling recruits the histone demethylase Jmjd3 to counteract polycomb-mediated repression at target genes,"Øyvind Dahle, Amit Kumar, Michael R Kuehn",2010/6/22,,3,127,ra48-ra48,American Association for the Advancement of Science,"Both intercellular signaling and epigenetic mechanisms regulate embryonic development, but it is unclear how they are integrated to establish and maintain lineage-specific gene expression programs. Here, we show that a key function of the developmentally essential Nodal-Smads2/3 (Smad2 and Smad3) signaling pathway is to recruit the histone demethylase Jmjd3 to target genes, thereby counteracting repression by Polycomb. Smads2/3 bound to Jmjd3 and recruited it to chromatin in a manner that was dependent on active Nodal signaling. Knockdown of Jmjd3 alone substantially reduced Nodal target gene expression, whereas in the absence of Polycomb, target loci were expressed independently of Nodal signaling. These data establish a role for Polycomb in imposing a dependency on Nodal signaling for the expression of target genes and reveal how developmental signaling integrates with epigenetic …",106회,"Nodal signaling recruits the histone demethylase Jmjd3 to counteract polycomb-mediated repression at target genes

Because bnAbs directed against a glycosylated site adjacent to the third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 envelope protein require limited SHM, the V3-glycan epitope is an attractive vaccine target. By studying the cooperation among multiple V3-glycan B cell lineages and their coevolution with autologous virus throughout 5 years of infection, we identify key events in the ontogeny of a V3-glycan bnAb.

Despite global efforts to combat tropical species extinctions, lack of high-quality, objective information on tropical biodiversity has hampered quantitative evaluation of conservation strategies. In particular, the scarcity of population-level monitoring in tropical forests has stymied assessment of biodiversity outcomes, such as the status and trends of animal populations in protected areas. Here, we evaluate occupancy trends for 511 populations of terrestrial mammals and birds, representing 244 species from 15 tropical forest protected areas on three continents. For the first time to our knowledge, we use annual surveys from tropical forests worldwide that employ a standardized camera trapping protocol, and we compute data analytics that correct for imperfect detection. We found that occupancy declined in 22%, increased in 17%, and exhibited no change in 22% of populations during the last 3–8 years, while 39% of populations were detected too infrequently to assess occupancy changes. Despite extensive variability in occupancy trends, these 15 tropical protected areas have not exhibited systematic declines in biodiversity (i.e., occupancy, richness, or evenness) at the community level. Our results differ from reports of widespread biodiversity declines based on aggregated secondary data and expert opinion and suggest less extreme deterioration in tropical forest protected areas.

Performance implications of mismatched governance regimes across external and internal relationships,"Alok Kumar, Jan B Heide, Kenneth H Wathne",2011/3,,75,2,1-17,SAGE Publications,"This article examines how a manufacturer's governance of an external supplier relationship affects its performance toward a downstream retail customer. In line with sociological and economic theory, a manufacturer's reliance on supplier norms and incentives, respectively, promotes performance. However, the performance effect of each external governance mechanism weakens in the presence of a different governance regime within the manufacturer firm itself. Specifically, internal incentives weaken the effect of external norms, and internal norms weaken the effect of external incentives. From a practical standpoint, these findings point to the difficulty of managing sets of relationships that involve different parties and mechanisms. From a theoretical standpoint, they point to the complex interplay between social norms and economic incentives in driving performance outcomes.",101회,"Performance implications of mismatched governance regimes across external and internal relationships

Long-term metformin use has been hypothesized to cause B12 deficiency and neuropathy in Type 2 diabetes patients. However, there is a paucity of Indian data regarding the same.
Aim:
To compare the prevalence of B12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with or without metformin.
Materials and Methods:
We recruited patients with Type 2 diabetes and divided them into metformin exposed and nonmetformin exposed groups. We measured baseline demographic variables like age, sex, vegetarian status, and HbA1c levels in both groups. We compared vitamin B12 levels and severity of peripheral neuropathy (using Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS)) in both groups.

Combining Patterned Self‐Assembled Monolayers of Alkanethiolates on Gold with Anisotropic Etching of Silicon to Generate Controlled Surface Morphologies,"Enoch Kim, Amit Kumar, George M Whitesides",1995/2/1,,142,2,628,IOP Publishing,"Self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) of hexadecanethiolate were patterned onto gold films supported on titanium‐primed silicon wafers using microcontact printing (μCP). Wet etching of the gold, and subsequently of the silicon, using three systems of resists based on these patterned SAMs, denoted by the shorthand labels Au/SAM, Ni/Au/SAM, and Au/SAM/polymer, produced features in silicon having dimensions in the 1 to 10 μm scale. In the Au/SAM system, the SAM acted as a resist to protect gold from etching by, and the resulting, patterned gold protected silicon from etching by (25% by volume) at 60 C.

Disentangling 3d pose in a dendritic cnn for unconstrained 2d face alignment,"Amit Kumar, Rama Chellappa",2018,,,,430-439,,"Heatmap regression has been used for landmark localization for quite a while now. Most of the methods use a very deep stack of bottleneck modules for heatmap classification stage, followed by heatmap regression to extract the keypoints. In this paper, we present a single dendritic CNN, termed as Pose Conditioned Dendritic Convolution Neural Network (PCD-CNN), where a classification network is followed by a second and modular classification network, trained in an end to end fashion to obtain accurate landmark points. Following a Bayesian formulation, we disentangle the 3D pose of a face image explicitly by conditioning the landmark estimation on pose, making it different from multi-tasking approaches. Extensive experimentation shows that conditioning on pose reduces the localization error by making it agnostic to face pose. The proposed model can be extended to yield variable number of landmark points and hence broadening its applicability to other datasets. Instead of increasing depth or width of the network, we train the CNN efficiently with Mask-Softmax Loss and hard sample mining to achieve upto 15% reduction in error compared to state-of-the-art methods for extreme and medium pose face images from challenging datasets including AFLW, AFW, COFW and IBUG.",89회,"Disentangling 3d pose in a dendritic cnn for unconstrained 2d face alignment

Restricting the As in aerial parts of rice plant may be an effective strategy to reduce As contamination in food chain. Sulfur (S), an essential element for plant growth and development, plays a crucial role in diminishing heavy metal toxicity. Current study is designed to investigate the role of S to mitigate As toxicity in rice under different S regimes. High S (5 mM) treatment resulted in enhanced root As accumulation as well as prevented its entry in to shoot. Results of thiol metabolism indicate that As was complexed in plant roots through enhanced synthesis of phytochelatins. High S treatment also reduced the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, the potent transporters of As in rice.

Arsenic accumulation, plant growth, thiolic ligands and antioxidative enzyme activities were assayed after single (As and Se) and simultaneous supplementations (As + Se). The results indicated that the presence of Se (25 µM) decreased As accumulation by threefold in roots and twofold in shoots as compared to single As (25 µM) exposed plants. Arsenic induced oxidative stress in roots and shoots was significantly ameliorated by Se supplementation.

Search for associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson decaying to b b-bar or gamma-gamma at sqrt (s)= 13 TeV,CMS collaboration,2017/3/15,,,,,,"A search for dark matter is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom quarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Results are interpreted in the context of a Z'-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended to a U (1)[Z'] group, with a new massive Z'gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z'decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m [Z']-m [A] phase space. For example, the observed data exclude the Z'mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for Z'coupling strength g [Z']= 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles g [chi]= 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan [beta]= 1, and m [A]= 300 GeV. The results of this analysis are valid for any dark matter particle mass below 100 GeV.",86회,"Search for associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson decaying to b b-bar or gamma-gamma at sqrt (s)= 13 TeV

Arsenate exposure has hampered the plant growth, reduced the chlorophyll content and enhanced the oxidative stress while the exogenous NO supplementation has reverted these symptoms. Nitric oxide supplementation has reduced the As accumulation in root as well as shoot. Nitric oxide supplementation to AsV exposed plants has reduced the gene expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2. Arsenate stress significantly impacted thiol metabolism, it reduced GSH content and GSH/GSSG ratio and enhanced the level of PCs. Nitric oxide supplementation maintained the GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced the level of PCs. Nitric oxide supplementation reverted AsV induced iron deficiency in shoot and had significant impact of gene expression level of various iron transporters (OsYSL2, OsFRDL1, OsIRT1 and OsIRO2).

It has been observed that the doping of CdTe QDs not only induced a pronounced memory effect but also affected the physical parameters of FLC material (LAHS19). The modifications in the physical parameters and memory effect of LAHS19 are found to depend on the concentration ratio of CdTe QDs. The lower concentration of CdTe QDs (1–3 wt%) enhanced the values of spontaneous polarization and rotational viscosity of LAHS19 material but did not favor the memory effect, whereas a higher concentration of CdTe QDs (> 5 wt%) degraded the alignment of LAHS19 material. The doping of∼ 5 wt% of CdTe QDs is found to be the most suitable for achieving good memory effect without significantly affecting the material parameters.",84회,"Effect of cadmium telluride quantum dots on the dielectric and electro-optical properties of ferroelectric liquid crystals

To help bridge this gap, we used phylogenetically corrected statistical methods to identify amino acid signature patterns in Envs derived from people who have made potently neutralizing antibodies, with the hypothesis that these Envs may share common features that would be useful for incorporation in a vaccine immunogen. Before attempting this, essentially as a control, we explored the utility of our computational methods for defining signatures of complex neutralization phenotypes by analyzing Env sequences from 251 clonal viruses that were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the well-characterized gp120-specific monoclonal antibody, b12. We identified ten b12-neutralization signatures, including seven either in the b12-binding surface of gp120 or in the V2 region of gp120 that have been previously shown to impact b12 sensitivity. A simple algorithm based on the b12 signature pattern was predictive of b12 sensitivity/resistance in an additional blinded panel of 57 viruses. Upon obtaining these reassuring outcomes, we went on to apply these same computational methods to define signature patterns in Env from HIV-1 infected individuals who had potent, broadly neutralizing responses.

Kepler: Keypoint and pose estimation of unconstrained faces by learning efficient h-cnn regressors,"Amit Kumar, Azadeh Alavi, Rama Chellappa",2017/5/30,,,,258-265,IEEE,"Keypoint detection is one of the most important pre-processing steps in tasks such as face modeling, recognition and verification. In this paper, we present an iterative method for Keypoint Estimation and Pose prediction of unconstrained faces by Learning Efficient H-CNN Regressors (KEPLER) for addressing the face alignment problem. Recent state of the art methods have shown improvements in face keypoint detection by employing Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Although a simple feed forward neural network can learn the mapping between input and output spaces, it cannot learn the inherent structural dependencies. We present a novel architecture called H-CNN (Heatmap-CNN) which captures structured global and local features and thus favors accurate keypoint detection. H-CNN is jointly trained on the visibility, fiducials and 3D-pose of the face.

Epigenetic control of HIV-1 post integration latency: implications for therapy,"Amit Kumar, Gilles Darcis, Carine Van Lint, Georges Herbein",2015/12,Clinical Epigenetics,7,1,1-12,BioMed Central,"With the development of effective combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART), there is significant reduction in deaths associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, the complete cure of HIV-1 infection is difficult to achieve without the elimination of latent reservoirs which exist in the infected individuals even under cART regimen. These latent reservoirs established during early infection have long life span, include resting CD4+ T cells, macrophages, central nervous system (CNS) resident macrophage/microglia, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue/macrophages, and can actively produce virus upon interruption of the cART. Several epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of viral latency. Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone post translational modifications (e.g., acetylation and methylation) and DNA methylation of the proviral DNA and microRNAs are involved in the establishment of HIV-1 latency. The better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms modulating HIV-1 latency could give clues for the complete eradication of these latent reservoirs. Several latency-reversing agents (LRA) have been found effective in reactivating HIV-1 reservoirs in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Some of these agents target epigenetic modifications to elicit viral expression in order to kill latently infected cells through viral cytopathic effect or host immune response. These therapeutic approaches aimed at achieving a sterilizing cure (elimination of HIV-1 from the human body). In the present review, we will discuss our current understanding of HIV-1 epigenomics and how this information can be …",77회,"Epigenetic control of HIV-1 post integration latency: implications for therapy

Troubleshooting these configuration errors is a major administration cost, especially in server clusters where problems often go undetected without user interference.
This paper presents CODE–a tool that automatically detects software configuration errors. Our approach is based on identifying invariant configuration access rules that predict what access events follow what contexts. It requires no source code, application-specific semantics, or heavyweight program analysis. Using these rules, CODE can sift through a voluminous number of events and detect deviant program executions. This is in contrast to previous approaches that focus on only diagnosis. In our experiments, CODE successfully detected a real configuration error in one of our deployment machines, in addition to 20 user-reported errors that we reproduced in our test environment. When analyzing month-long event logs from both user desktops and production servers, CODE yielded a low false positive rate. The efficiency of CODE makes it feasible to be deployed as a practical management tool with low overhead.",76회,"Context-based online configuration-error detection

Moreover, reconstitution of p85α‐deficient cells with a Δp85α mutant, which does not bind the catalytic subunit, corrected the cytokinesis defects of p85α−/− cells. We analyzed the mechanism by which p85α regulates cytokinesis; p85α deletion reduced Cdc42 activation in the cleavage furrow and septin 2 accumulation at this site.

Motor current signature analysis for bearing fault detection in mechanical systems,"Sukhjeet Singh, Amit Kumar, Navin Kumar",2014/1/1,,6,,171-177,Elsevier,Bearings are one of the critical components in rotating machinery. The need of an easy and effective fault diagnosis technique has led to the increasing use of motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Bearing faults in the mechanical system run by an induction motor causes change in its stator current spectrum. The faults in the bearings cause variations of load irregularities in the magnetic field which in turn change the mutual and self inductance causing side bands across the line frequency. The objective of this paper is to detect bearing faults (outer race fault) in a mechanical system using motor current signature. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is initially employed for a first comparison between a healthy and a defective bearing. Six wavelets are considered out of which three are real valued and remaining three are complex valued.

Based on these studies, a fivecoordinated square pyramidal geometry for all the complexes was proposed. The Schiff base ligand and the complexes were also tested for their antimicrobial activity (against the bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus megaterium, and the fungi Kluyveromyces fragilis, Rhodotorula rubra, Candida albicans and Trichoderma reesei) to assess their inhibiting potential. An attempt was also made to correlate the antimicrobial activity with the geometry of the complexes.

This approach is amalgamation of homotopy analysis method, Laplace transform, and homotopy polynomials. First, we present an alternative framework of the method that can be used simply and effectively to handle nonlinear problems arising in several physical phenomena. Then, existence and uniqueness of solutions for the fractional Lotka–Volterra equations are discussed. We also carry out a detailed analysis on the stability of equilibrium. Further, we have derived the approximate solutions of predator and prey populations for different particular cases by using initial values. The numerical simulations of the result are depicted through different graphical representations showing that this hybrid analytic method is reliable and powerful method to solve linear …",65회,"A nonlinear fractional model to describe the population dynamics of two interacting species

Permeation of antigen protein-conjugated nanoparticles and live bacteria through microneedle-treated mouse skin,"Amit Kumar, Xinran Li, Michael A Sandoval, B Leticia Rodriguez, Brian R Sloat, Zhengrong Cui",2011,,6,,1253,Dove Press,"Background:
The present study was designed to evaluate the extent to which pretreatment with microneedles can enhance skin permeation of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Permeation of live bacteria, which are physically nanoparticles or microparticles, through mouse skin pretreated with microneedles was also studied to evaluate the potential risk of microbial infection.
Methods and results:
It was found that pretreatment of mouse skin with microneedles allowed permeation of solid lipid nanoparticles, size 230 nm, with ovalbumin conjugated on their surface. Transcutaneous immunization in a mouse skin area pretreated with microneedles with ovalbumin nanoparticles induced a stronger antiovalbumin antibody response than using ovalbumin alone. The dose of ovalbumin antigen determined whether microneedle-mediated transcutaneous immunization with ovalbumin nanoparticles induced a stronger immune …",65회,"Permeation of antigen protein-conjugated nanoparticles and live bacteria through microneedle-treated mouse skin

The proposed method consists of three modules. The first one is a DCNN-based age group classifier which classifies a given face image into age groups. The second module is a collection of DCNN-based regressors which compute the fine-grained age estimate corresponding in each age class. Finally, any erroneous age prediction is corrected using an error-correcting mechanism. Experimental evaluations on three publicly available datasets for age estimation show that the proposed approach is able to reliably estimate the age; in addition, the coarse-to-fine strategy and the error correction module significantly improve the performance.",61회,"A cascaded convolutional neural network for age estimation of unconstrained faces

The development of focused and evidence-based health interventions to reduce neonatal mortality warrants an examination of factors affecting it. Therefore, this study attempt to examine individual, household, and community level factors affecting neonatal mortality in rural India.
Data and methods. We analysed information on 171,529 singleton live births using the data from the most recent round of the District Level Household Survey conducted in 2007–08. Principal component analysis was used to create an asset index. Two-level logistic regression was performed to analyse the factors associated with neonatal deaths in rural India.
Results. The odds of neonatal death were lower for neonates born to mothers with secondary level education (O R = 0.60, p = 0.01) compared to those born to illiterate mothers. A progressive reduction in the odds occurred as the level of fathers’ education increased. The odds of neonatal death were lower for infants born to unemployed mothers (O R = 0.89, p = 0.00) compared to those who worked as agricultural worker/farmer/laborer. The odds decreased if neonates belonged to Scheduled Tribes (O R = 0.72, p = 0.00) or ‘Others’ caste group (O R = 0.87, p = 0.04) and to the households with access to improved sanitation (O R = 0.87, p = 0.02), pucca house (O R = 0.87, p = 0.03) and electricity (O R = 0.84, p = 0.00). The odds were higher for male infants (O R = 1.21, p = 0.00) and whose …",58회,"Determinants of neonatal mortality in rural India, 2007–2008

These infectious respiratory disorders are divided into two groups: the diseases of upper respiratory tract, namely, nasal myiasis and enzootic nasal tumors, and diseases of lower respiratory tract, namely, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), parainfluenza, Pasteurellosis, Ovine progressive pneumonia, mycoplasmosis, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, caseous lymphadenitis, verminous pneumonia, and many others. Depending upon aetiology, many of them are acute and fatal in nature. Early, rapid, and specific diagnosis of such diseases holds great importance to reduce the losses. The advanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of antigen as well as antibodies directly from the samples and molecular diagnostic assays along with microsatellites comprehensively assist in diagnosis as well as treatment and epidemiological studies. The present review discusses the advancements made in the diagnosis of common infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats. It would update the knowledge and help in adapting and implementing appropriate, timely, and confirmatory diagnostic procedures. Moreover, it would assist in designing appropriate prevention protocols and devising suitable control strategies to overcome respiratory diseases and alleviate the economic losses.",57회,"Advances in diagnosis of respiratory diseases of small ruminants

Bacteriophage therapy for safeguarding animal and human health: a review.,"Ruchi Tiwari, Kuldeep Dhama, Amit Kumar, Anu Rahal, Sanjay Kapoor",2014/2/1,Pakistan journal of biological sciences: PJBS,17,3,301-315,,"Since the discovery of bacteriophages at the beginning of the 19th century their contribution to bacterial evolution and ecology and use in a variety of applications in biotechnology and medicine has been recognized and understood. Bacteriophages are natural bacterial killers, proven as best biocontrol agents due to their ability to lyse host bacterial cells specifically thereby helping in disease prevention and control. The requirement of such therapeutic approach is straight away required in view of the global emergence of Multidrug Resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics in both animals and humans along with increasing food safety concerns including of residual antibiotic toxicities. Phage typing is a popular tool to differentiate bacterial isolates and to identify and characterize outbreak-associated strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia and Listeria. Numerous methods viz. plaque morphology, ultracentrifugation in the density gradient of CsCl2, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) have been found to be effective in detection of various phages. Bacteriophages have been isolated and recovered from samples of animal waste products of different livestock farms. High titer cocktails of broad spectrum lytic bacteriophages are usually used for clinical trial for assessing their therapeutic efficacy against antibiotic unresponsive infections in different animals. Bacteriophage therapy also helps to fight various bacterial infections of poultry viz. colibacillosis, salmonellosis and listeriosis.

Although, the disease is rare and sporadic in poultry but if occurs then causes septicemia or sometimes localized encephalitis. Occasionally, the disease is seen in young chicks and the causative agent, like in humans and animals, is Listeria monocytogenes. The organism is capable to infect almost all animals and poultry; however, outbreaks of listeriosis are infrequent in birds. It is widely distributed among avian species and chickens, turkeys, waterfowl (geese, ducks), game birds, pigeons, parrots, wood grouse, snowy owl, eagle, canaries, which appear to be the most commonly affected. Chickens are thought to be the carriers of Listeria and also the prime reservoirs for the infection and thus contaminate the litter and environment of the poultry production units. Listeriosis is often noticed along with other poultry diseases such as coccidiosis, infectious coryza, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and parasitic infections, signifying the opportunistic nature of the organism. Intestinal colonization of poultry and the presence of L. monocytogenes in feces represent a potential source of the organism for listeriosis in ruminants. Man gets infection from raw broiler meat due to Listeria contamination and unhygienic conditions of the processing area, rather than acquiring direct infection from birds. With the changing food habits of the people, the health consciousness is also increasing and since listeriosis has now been recognized as an emerging food borne zoonoses. Therefore, this review has been compiled to make aware the poultry producers and the consumers …",53회,"Listeria monocytogenes infection in poultry and its public health importance with special reference to food borne zoonoses.

A low frequency dielectric mode, along with the Goldstone mode, was observed in the SmC* phase of the FLC material. The low frequency mode became more dominant on doping gold nanoparticles into the FLC material. The occurrence of the low frequency mode was attributed to the ionisation–recombination-assisted diffusion of slow ions present in the FLC material.

Water pollutants such as heavy metals and nanoparticles can undergo bioaccumulation and bioaugmentation. Heavy metals cannot be degraded and are hence added permanently. Nanoparticles are a potential threat because of their small size and unique properties. This article reviews the impact of various pollutants on aquatic biota and presents remediation methods. Benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bioindicators to study the impact of pollutants on aquatic ecosystems. Fishes occupy the highest trophic level in the aquatic food chain and can therefore accumulate large amounts of metal from water, ultimately leading to biomagnification. Some organic compounds such as pesticides and fungicides are carcinogenic and sometimes resistant to degradation.",50회,"Impact of heavy metals and nanoparticles on aquatic biota

Rice quality under water stress,"Avinash Pandey, A Kumar, DS Pandey, PD Thongbam",2014,,1,2,23-26,,"About 13% of the world‟ s 156 million ha of rice is cultivated as rainfed rice under upland conditions where moisture stress affects rice growth and reduces grain yield and quality. Water stress affects plant growth and development and ultimately, reduces grain yield of rice. The reduction in yield may depend on the developmental stage of the crop. The response of rice yield to soil water status varies with growth stage being most sensitive at flowering, followed by booting and grain filling stage. More reduction in grain yield, due to water stress in flowering stage, is largely resulted from the reduction in fertile panicle and filled grain percentage. Water stress also promoted the remobilization of stored carbon reserves and water deficit during grain-filling enhanced plant senescence and accelerated grain-filling. It is generally believed that rice quality is determined both genetically and environmentally. Soil water status, especially during the grain filling period, has a dramatic influence on grain quality of rice.",50회,"Rice quality under water stress

Energy-efficient mobile data collection in wireless sensor networks with delay reduction using wireless communication,"Arun K Kumar, Krishna M Sivalingam",2010/1/5,,,,1-10,IEEE,"In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), battery power is a limited resource on the sensor nodes. Hence, the amount of power consumption by the nodes determines the node and network lifetime. This in turn has an impact on the connectivity and coverage of the network. One way to reduce power consumed is to use a special Mobile Data Collector (MDC) for data gathering, instead of multi-hop data transmission to the sink. The MDC collects the data from the nodes and transfers it to the sink. Various kinds of MDC approaches have been explored for different assumptions and constraints. But in all the models proposed, the data latency is usually high, due to the slow speed of the mobile nodes.

It occurs in many parts of the world and most notably in the Mediterranean Basin. Following the infection common complications are septicaemia, mastitis, arthritis, pleurisy, pneumonia, and keratoconjunctivitis. Primary or tentative diagnosis of the organism is based upon clinical signs. Various serological tests, namely, growth precipitation, immunofluorescence, complement fixation test, haemagglutination inhibition, agglutination, immunodiffusion, enzyme immunoassays, immunoelectrophoresis, blotting techniques, and others, are available. Molecular tools seem to be much more sensitive, specific, and faster and help to differentiate various strains. The real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, quantitative PCR, PCR-RFLP, MLST, and gene probes, complementary to segments of chromosomal DNA or 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), have strengthened the diagnosis of M. agalactiae. Both live attenuated and adjuvant (alum precipitated or saponified) inactivated vaccines are available with greater use of inactivated ones due to lack of side effects. The present review discusses the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical signs of contagious agalactia in small ruminants along with trends and advances in its diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, prevention, and control strategies that will help in countering this disease.",48회,"Mycoplasma agalactiae, an etiological agent of contagious agalactia in small ruminants: a review

The role of viruses in the development and exacerbation of atopic disease,"Amit Kumar, Mitchell H Grayson",2009/9/1,"Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",103,3,181-187,Elsevier,"Objective
To examine data in support of the viral hypothesis of atopic disease.
Data Sources
We retrieved review articles and original research from MEDLINE, OVID, and PubMed (1950-June 2009) that addressed our topic of interest, using the terms respiratory virus, asthma, IgE, atopy, and viral-induced wheeze.
Study Selection
Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma.
Results
Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic …",48회,"The role of viruses in the development and exacerbation of atopic disease

Issues regarding food safety along with increased drug resistance and emerging zoonotic infections have proved that multidisciplinary efforts are in demand for human and animal welfare. This has led to development of various novel therapies the list of which remains incomplete without mentioning about phages. Homologous and non-homologous recombination along with point mutation and addition of new genes play role in their evolution. The rapid emergence of the antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria have created keen interest in finding necessary alternatives to check microbial infections and there comes the importance of phages. Phages kill the bacteria either by lysis or by releasing holins. Bacteriophages; the viruses that live on bacteria are nowadays considered as the best biocontrol agents.

Toward a unified model to prevent humping defects in gas tungsten arc welding,"A Kumar, T DebRoy",2006/12/1,,85,12,292,,"During gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding, high welding speed and current can lead to a serious weld defect with a bead-like appearance known as humping. Currently, there is no unified model to predict the formation of humping defects in GTA welding. Here we propose and test a new comprehensive computational model that can predict and prevent the formation of humping defects considering the values of arc current, welding speed, nature of the shielding gas, electrode geometry, ambient pressure, torch angle, and external magnetic field during gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding. The model considers stability of the waves on the weld pool surface due to relative motion between the shielding gas and the liquid metal based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability theory. The main factors for the instability were found to be the velocities of the shielding gas and the weld metal, densities of the molten metal and shielding gas, weld pool size, and surface tension of the molten weld metal. The weld pool size and weld metal velocities were calculated by a numerical heat transfer and fluid flow model, and the shielding gas velocity was calculated from an analytical relation. Good agreement between the model predictions of humping and the independent experimental results from various sources show that the model can be used to prevent humping considering the effects of arc current, welding speed, nature of the shielding gas, electrode geometry, ambient pressure, torch angle, and external magnetic field during GTA welding. Recommendations are provided for the use of special electrodes and an external magnetic field and, where practical, controlled …",47회,"Toward a unified model to prevent humping defects in gas tungsten arc welding

Their molecular structure is a dense network of AlO 4 and SiO 4 that generates cavities where water and other polar molecules or ions are inserted/exchanged. Even though there are several synthetic or natural occurring species of zeolites, the most widespread and studied is the naturally occurring zeolite clinoptilolite (ZC). ZC is an excellent detoxifying, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. As a result, it is been used in many industrial applications ranging from environmental remediation to oral applications/supplementation in vivo in humans as food supplements or medical devices. Moreover, the modification as micronization of ZC (M-ZC) or tribomechanically activated zeolite clinoptilolite (TMAZ) or furthermore as double tribomechanically activated zeolite clinoptilolite (PMA-ZC) allows improving its benefits in preclinical and clinical models. Despite its extensive use, many underlying action mechanisms of ZC in its natural or modified forms are still unclear, especially in humans. The main aim of this review is to shed light on the geochemical aspects and therapeutic potentials of ZC with a vision of endorsing further preclinical and clinical research on zeolites, in specific on the ZC and its modified forms as a potential agent for promoting human brain health and overall well-being.

Here, a 3D network of graphene oxide is deposited from solution on the template and then is chemically reduced. Following steps of ZnO nanowire growth, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) backfilling and electrode lamination completes the fabrication processes. When compared to conventional generators with 2D planar geometry, the sponge template provides a 3D structure that has a potential to increase power density per unit area. The modified one-pot ZnO synthesis method allows the whole process to be inexpensive and environmentally benign. The nanogenerator yields an open circuit voltage of ∼0.5 V and short circuit current density of ∼2 μA/cm2, while the output was found to be …",45회,"Sponge-templated macroporous graphene network for piezoelectric ZnO nanogenerator

Research Design and Methods: We analyzed the drugs, investigations, consultation and monitoring related data available from a survey of 35-65 year old known diabetes patients conducted using a probability-proportionate–tosize 2-stage cluster design to calculate the direct cost of ambulatory diabetes care. Results: A total of 819 subjects were enrolled from 20,666 houses. The average estimate of direct annual expenditure on ambulatory care of diabetes was~ Rs. 6000 (~ US $150). Time elapsed since diagnosis (p< 0.001), education (p= 0.011), gross family income (p= 0.002), presence of co-morbidities (p= 0.009) and requirement for use of oral hypoglycemic agents (p< 0.001) or insulin (p< 0.001) were significant correlates. Direct ambulatory cost of care comprised 1-3% of the gross family income of the subjects.
Conclusion: Despite the limitations of the present study it may be concluded that a majority of the diabetes patients spend a significant proportion of their family income on diabetes related expenditure. The cost is higher for subjects with longer duration since diagnosis, those with higher education or income, those with co-morbidities and those requiring oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin.© the direct cost of ambulatory diabetes care, to evaluate the socio-demographic associates of spending, and to ascertain the relationship of spending with the delivered quality of diabetes care.",45회,"Direct cost of ambulatory care of type 2 diabetes in the middle and high income group populace of Delhi: the DEDICOM survey

Inguinal lymph node dissection allows staging and treatment of inguinal nodal disease. However, it causes morbidity and is associated with complications, such as lymphocele, skin loss and infection. Video Endoscopic Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (VEIL) is an endoscopic procedure, and it seems to be a new and attractive approach duplicating the standard open procedure with less morbidity. We present here a critical perioperative assessment with points of technique. Ten patients with moderate to high grade penile carcinoma with clinically negative inguinal lymph nodes were subjected to elective VEIL. VEIL was done in standard surgical steps. Perioperative parameters were assessed that is - duration of the surgery, lymph-related complications, time until drain removal, lymph node yield, surgical emphysema and histopathological positivity of lymph nodes. Operative time for VEIL was 120 to180 minutes. Lymph node yield was 7 to 12 lymph nodes. No skin related complications were seen with VEIL. Lymph related complications, that is, lymphocele, were seen in only two patients. The suction drain was removed after four to eight days (mean 5.1). Overall morbidity was 20% with VEIL. In our early experience, VEIL was a safe and feasible technique in patients with penile carcinoma with non palpable inguinal lymph nodes. It allows the removal of inguinal lymph nodes within the same limits as in conventional surgical dissection and potentially reduces surgical morbidity.",43회,"Video Endoscopic Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (VEIL)-a prospective critical perioperative assessment of feasibility and morbidity with points of technique in penile carcinoma

Premature T cell senescence in Ovx mice is inhibited by repletion of estrogen and medicarpin: a possible mechanism for alleviating bone loss,"AM Tyagi, K Srivastava, J Kureel, A Kumar, A Raghuvanshi, D Yadav, R Maurya, A Goel, D Singh",2012/3,,23,3,1151-1161,Springer-Verlag,"Summary
Presently the relationship between CD28, biological marker of senescence, and ovariectomy is not well understood. We show that ovariectomy leads to CD28 loss on T cells and estrogen (E2) repletion and medicarpin (Med) inhibits this effect. We thus propose that Med/E2 prevents bone loss by delaying premature T cell senescence.
Introduction
Estrogen deficiency triggers reproductive aging by accelerating the amplification of TNF-α-producing T cells, thereby leading to bone loss. To date, no study has been carried out to explain the relationship between CD4+CD28null T cells and ovariectomy or osteoporosis. We aim to determine the effect of Ovx on CD28 expression on T cells and effects of E2 and medicarpin (a pterocarpan phytoalexin) with proven osteoprotective effect on altered T cell responses …",43회,"Premature T cell senescence in Ovx mice is inhibited by repletion of estrogen and medicarpin: a possible mechanism for alleviating bone loss

Among the different forms of Aβ aggregates, smaller aggregates called ‘soluble oligomers’ are increasingly believed to be the primary neurotoxic species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction. Since it is well known that the Aβ aggregation is a nucleation dependant process, it is widely believed that the toxic oligomers are intermediates to fibril formation, or what we call the ‘on-pathway’ products. Modeling of Aβ aggregation has been of intense investigation during the last decade. However, precise understanding of the process, pre-nucleation events in particular, are not yet known. Most of these models are based on curve-fitting and overlook the molecular-level biophysics involved in the aggregation pathway.

Evidences for Piperine inhibiting cancer by targeting human G-quadruplex DNA sequences,"Arpita Tawani, Ayeman Amanullah, Amit Mishra, Amit Kumar",2016/12/20,,6,1,1-12,Nature Publishing Group,"Piperine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, is well known as anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-tumor and anti-proliferative agent. Piperine exerts such pharmacological activities by binding or interacting with various cellular targets. Recently, the first report for Piperine interaction with duplex DNA has been published last year but its interaction with G-quadruplex structures has not been studied yet. Herein, we report for the first time the interaction of Piperine with various DNA G-quadruplex structures. Comprehensive biophysical techniques were employed to determine the basis of interaction for the complex formed between Piperine and G-quadruplex DNA sequences. Piperine showed specificity for G-quadruplex DNA over double stranded DNA, with highest affinity for G-quadruplex structure formed at c-myc promoter region.

Soft tissue coverage in open fractures of tibia,"Jagannath B Kamath, M Shantaram Shetty, Thangam Verghese Joshua, Ajith Kumar, Deepak M Naik",2012/8,,46,,462-469,Springer India,"Background
The treatment of Gustilo Anderson type 3B open fracture tibia is a major challenge and it needs aggressive debridement, adequate fixation, and early flap coverage of soft tissue defect. The flaps could be either nonmicrovascular which are technically less demanding or microvascular which has steep learning curve and available only in few centers. An orthopedic surgeon with basic knowledge of the local vascular anatomy required to harvest an appropriate local or regional flap will be able to manage a vast majority of open fracture tibia, leaving the very few complicated cases needing a free microvascular flap to be referred to specialized tertiary center. This logical approach to the common problem will also lessen the burden on the higher tertiary centers. We report a retrospective study of open fractures of leg treated by nonmicrovascular flaps to analyze (1) the role of …",42회,"Soft tissue coverage in open fractures of tibia

Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: current status and future strategies for management,"Vibhuti Singh, Rakesh Sharma, Ajoy Kumar, Prakash Deedwania",2010,Vascular health and risk management,6,,979,Dove Press,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the foremost cause of death and disability in the Western world, and it is rapidly becoming so in the developing nations. Even though the use of statin therapy aiming at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) has significantly reduced cardiovascular events and mortality, substantial residual cardiac events still occur in those being treated to the currently recommended targets. In fact, residual risk is also seen in those who are treated “aggressively” such as the “high risk” patients so defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Consequently, one must look for the predictors of risk beyond LDL reduction. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) is the next frontier. The protectiveness of elevated HDL against atherosclerosis is well described in the literature.

Atherogenic dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus: what’s new in the management arena?,"Ajoy Kumar, Vibhuti Singh",2010,Vascular health and risk management,6,,665,Dove Press,"When compared with the general population, the diabetic population is at higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as predicted by the Framingham Risk Score calculations (10-year risk 20%). For this reason diabetes is considered a “coronary disease equivalent” condition, as classified by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III. Furthermore, patients with diabetes who experience a myocardial infarction have a poorer prognosis than nondiabetic patients, which contributes to their overall higher mortality. Dyslipidemia is a major underlying risk factor contributing to the excess CVD risk, and is usually more atherogenic in the presence of diabetes. It is uniquely manifested by raised levels of triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smaller, denser, and more atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particles.

Previously defined as enlarged anovulatory follicle like structures (< 2.5 cm) and persisting for 10 or more days OC in dairy cows are currently defined as cystic ovarian follicular structures of at least 17 mm that persist for more than 6 days in the absence of corpus luteum. However, clear cut definitions of this disorder are yet to be made. Past evaluations of OC using transrectal palpations have increased, and accurate diagnosis currently employs a combination of transrectal palpation, transrectal ultrasonography and plasma progesterone assay. However, the accurate diagnosis of the type of OC seems less important as therapies are similar for both the types of OC and clinicians often evaluate the OC again under conditions of pregnancy failures. During earlier times, the manual rupture of OC was advocated, yet during the past several years single or combination hCG, GnRH, progesterone and prostaglandins have been frequent in clinical practice. Other therapies include estrogen receptor blocker clomiphene citrate and trans-vaginal ultrasound guided cystic follicle aspiration. Among the various therapies suggested the OvSynch treatment appears to be the most logical approach, yet the pregnancy rates with timed inseminations following therapy with the OvSynch treatment are low, as with other hormonal treatments. The success of therapy is governed by many confounding variables such as persistence of the cystic follicles and initiation of therapy as pathological alterations that occur following OC persistence require some time for …",41회,"Ovarian cysts in dairy cows: old and new concepts for definition, diagnosis and therapy

Non-esterified fatty acids generate distinct low-molecular weight amyloid-β (Aβ42) oligomers along pathway different from fibril formation,"Amit Kumar, Rebekah L Bullard, Pritesh Patel, Lea C Paslay, Dipti Singh, Ewa A Bienkiewicz, Sarah E Morgan, Vijayaraghavan Rangachari",2011/4/19,,6,4,e18759,Public Library of Science,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregation is known to play a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Among various aggregates, low-molecular weight soluble oligomers of Aβ are increasingly believed to be the primary neurotoxic agents responsible for memory impairment. Anionic interfaces are known to influence the Aβ aggregation process significantly. Here, we report the effects of interfaces formed by medium-chain (C9–C12), saturated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) on Aβ42 aggregation. NEFAs uniquely affected Aβ42 aggregation rates that depended on both the ratio of Aβ:NEFA as well the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the NEFAs. More importantly, irrespective of the kind of NEFA used, we observed that two distinct oligomers, 12–18 mers and 4–5 mers were formed via different pathway of aggregation under specific experimental conditions: (i) 12–18 mers were generated near the CMC in which NEFAs augment the rate of Aβ42 aggregation towards fibril formation, and, (ii) 4–5 mers were formed above the CMC, where NEFAs inhibit fibril formation. The data indicated that both 12–18 mers and 4–5 mers are formed along an alternate pathway called ‘off-pathway’ that did not result in fibril formation and yet have subtle structural and morphological differences that distinguish their bulk molecular behavior. These observations, (i) reflect the possible mechanism of Aβ aggregation in physiological lipid-rich environments, and (ii) reiterate the fact that all oligomeric forms of Aβ need not be obligatory intermediates of the fibril formation pathway.",41회,"Non-esterified fatty acids generate distinct low-molecular weight amyloid-β (Aβ42) oligomers along pathway different from fibril formation

A single diaphragm increases the local regression rate and its influence is prominent only in the region immediate downstream. Therefore, a tangible increment in average regression rate with a single diaphragm can only be realized for motors with small .

The etiological agent E. coli is also considered as important food borne pathogen (Dhama et al., 2013a). Similarly, Sizov et al.(1984) also observed the presence of E. coli in 34 percent samples of calves in the age group of 3 to 10 days that died due to diarrhoea. Among the multiple predisposing factors of diarrhoea due to bacterial causes especially E. coli, risk is greater in calves in which there has been failure of passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulin (Gay 1983). Inspite of the complex etiology of calf diarrhea, the involvement of bacterial pathogens is still responsible for more than 50% cases of diarrhoea in neonatal calves (Kumar et al., 2012a, b) and E. coli is more or less consistently isolated during cultural examination of the intestinal contents of calves that succumb to diarrhoea complex during first three weeks of life (Boyd et al., 1974; Malik et al., 2012).

As a consequence, the volume of electronic waste is increasing drastically around the globe. With the implementation of new rules, regulations, and policies by the government, the landfilling of electronic waste has been reduced. The presence of valuable metals in the e-waste stream provides a major economic benefit for recycling industries but, due to the presence of hazardous materials, a proper recycling technique is required prior to the disposal of the e-waste. The total e-waste generated in Canada was 725 kt in 2014. There are several organizations currently working in various provinces to deal with the collection and recycling of e-waste. These organizations collected nearly 20% of the total e-waste generated in 2014. The collection rate for e-waste can be boosted by increasing awareness and by creating more centers to collect all kinds of e-waste. The collected e-waste is processed at local processing facilities mostly dealing with dismantling and hazardous material removal processes and then shipping the remaining material to a central location for subsequent processing.

It builds on an existing Green DEA model and modifies it to include a carbon market model. Results from the model validation in a well known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India indicate that the “Pay Up” factor from carbon trading adds a new dimension to competition among suppliers and increases overall supply chain profitability. The proposed approach encourages suppliers to go green and cut down their carbon footprints or “Pay Up” to comply with the emission norms along with cutting costs, which adds to healthy competition.",36회,"An integrated buyer initiated decision-making process for green supplier selection

By purification studies it was deduced that PDC-109 is a polypeptide of 109 amino acids and contains two tandem repeating fibronectin type-II (Fn-II) domains, preceded by a 23 residue N-terminal domain. Though BSP-A1 and BSP-A2 are biochemically similar they differ only in glycosylation and their mixture is called PDC-109 or gonadostatins. PDC-109 exists as a polydisperse, multimeric self-associated molecule and possesses multifunctional …",36회,"Bovine seminal PDC-109 protein: An overview of biochemical and functional properties

Built-up and vegetation extraction and density mapping using WorldView-II,"Amit Kumar, Arvind Chandra Pandey, AT Jeyaseelan",2012/11/1,,27,7,557-568,Taylor & Francis,"This study demonstrates the use of high resolution WorldView-II satellite data in extraction of built-up land and vegetation using normalized index techniques. The PCA 1 and NIR 2 bands-based built-up index was proposed for extracting built-up land, which exhibit high accuracy. The normalized difference vegetation index based on Red Edge and NIR 2 bands of WorldView-II produced high accuracy inthe estimation of vegetation compared to the use of Red and NIR bands. The grid technique used in estimating built-up and vegetation density from precisely classified images provided better and accurate assessment of built-up and vegetation density in heterogeneous landscape of urban areas. This shows areas of very high to high built-up density are located in the central, western and southern parts, which are primarily devoid of vegetation. This study indicates possibilities of utilizing high resolution satellite data …",36회,"Built-up and vegetation extraction and density mapping using WorldView-II

"Poly (3-hexylthiophene): Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes:(6, 6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester composites for photovoltaic cell at ambient condition","Rajiv K Singh, Jitendra Kumar, Amit Kumar, Vikram Kumar, Rama Kant, Ramadhar Singh",2010/12/1,,94,12,2386-2394,North-Holland,"We report the synthesis and characterization of nonhygroscopic composites of poly(3-hexylthiophene):functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes:(6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:FSWCNT:PCBM) for photovoltaic applications. The composite films have been characterized for their structural, electronic, photo-physical and photovoltaic properties. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) investigation suggests that the nanotubes can induce structural changes in P3HT matrix. The homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in P3HT and its self-arranged matrix in P3HT:PCBM are evident from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrum indicates the betterment of P3HT chain stacking by addition of nanotubes, which is further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to determine the bulk microstructure of the …",36회,"Poly (3-hexylthiophene): Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes:(6, 6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester composites for photovoltaic cell at ambient condition

Neutralization of genetically diverse HIV-1 strains by IgA antibodies to the gp120 CD4 binding site from long-term survivors of HIV infection,"Stephanie Planque, Maria Salas, Yukie Mitsuda, Marcin Sienczyk, Miguel A Escobar, Jason P Mooney, Mary-Kate Morris, Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Dipanjan Ghosh, Amit Kumar, Feng Gao, Carl V Hanson, Sudhir Paul",2010/3/27,,24,6,875,NIH Public Access,"Design
Diverse HIV-1 strains express few structurally constant regions on their surface vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies. The mostly-conserved CD4 binding site (CD4BS) of gp120 is essential for host cell binding and infection by the virus. Antibodies that recognize the CD4BS are rare, and one component of the CD4BS, the 421–433 peptide region, expresses B cell superantigenic character, a property predicted to impair the anti-CD4BS adaptive immune response.
Methods
IgA samples purified from the plasma of subjects with HIV infection were analyzed for the ability to bind synthetic mimetics containing the 416–433 gp120 region and full-length gp120. Infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by clinical HIV isolates was measured by p24 ELISA.
Results
IgA preparations from 3 subjects with subtype B infection for 19–21 years neutralized heterologous, coreceptor CCR5-dependent subtype A, B, C, D and …",36회,"Neutralization of genetically diverse HIV-1 strains by IgA antibodies to the gp120 CD4 binding site from long-term survivors of HIV infection
